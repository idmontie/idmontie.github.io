GILD is a 2 player game. One person creates a Room, and the other player joins iit. Both players take turns summoning monsters using their given ingredients and having the mosnters fight. First to 3 wins is the victor!

(P.S. if you don't have anyone else to play with, you can access the site in two different browsers, or one browser using Incognito Mode).
