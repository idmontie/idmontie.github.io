This short post was originally on a blog I started for creating web applications. This post goes into mobile considerations for web applications.

## Tools to Sync Mobile and Web Development

These tools not only help with Mobile development, but they also help with cross-browser development as well (see Developer Tools):

* [Ghostlab](http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/) - Synchronized browser testing for web and mobile.  Test files and URLs against multiple devices by syncing clicks, scrolls, keystrokes across the devices. $49 for a license.
* [Edge Inspect CC](https://creative.adobe.com/products/inspect) - Synchronized Browsing & Refreshing. Test files and URLs agaisnt multiple devices at once.  Part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.
