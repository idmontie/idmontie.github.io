But why has it become so popular? It truly is a revolutionary piece of technology. Is it The Next Big Thing? Will it really replace all of us?\n\nMy day to day is architecture and programming, and I’ve heard all sorts of things on Twitter:\n\n- That ChatGPT can build entire iOS applications\n- ChatGPT can write whole files of code\n- ChatGPT can find bugs in code when writing tests\n\nWhen I started by own company Clarity Hub, we had a focus on machine learning to help augment human intelligence. My thought at the time was that we could leverage machine learning to augment and supplement human intelligence. The focus wouldn't be to replace any person's job, but to make it streamlined and easier to accomplish that job. Our journey started with us serving customer success agents with suggested replies and contextual information, but we eventually pivoted to a Dovetail-like application to help product teams gather, annotate, and contextualize customer interviews.\n\nWe found that augmenting activity with machine learning was not only easier to do from a technology point of view, but empowered users, rather than make them feel like their job was being replaced.\n\nEven with the advent of ChatGPT, I still see this being the short term future of it's use.\n\n## False Starts\n\nI was curious how much ChatGPT could really do given all of its hype  \n\nI asked it to build an Asteroids game using PhaserJS. Don’t worry, this isn’t another article on “Look, I got ChatGPT to build a game!”\n\nI originally just asked ChatGPT to build an Asteroids game using PhaserJS. A very vague prompt, yes, but a great starting point to figure out the limitations of ChatGPT.\n\nThe response was basically, “No I can’t”:\n\n\u003e As an AI language model, I'm not able to write and execute code in real-time. However, I can provide you with a detailed framework to get started with creating an Asteroids game in PhaserJS.\n\nThis was followed by instructions on how I could do it myself.\n\nThe next steps of course are to be more specific, asking ChatGPT to build the application to build specific functionality:\n\n\u003e Add the code to let the player shoot asteroids. If the player gets hit by 3 asteroids, its game over\n\nMost interactions with ChatGPT seem to go like this:\n\n![Flowchart workflow](/media/2023-07-23-chatgpt-coding-loop/Flowchart_Template_1.jpg)\n\nThis flow eventually leads to either:\n\n- Not getting what you want.\n- Getting what you want across many different responses, and then you must manually coalesce all of the different responses together to form the result you want.\n\nOnce I like the set of responses that ChatGPT has given me, I’ll ask ChatGPT to summarize for me so that I can improve the prompt further:\n\n\u003e Take everything we just talked about and give me a prompt to ask you in the future that encapsulates all of the requirements.\n\n## A More Natural Flow\n\nI’ve talked with ChatGPT on a variety of topics, but the majority of questions relate to coding. I actively use Github Copilot, which utilizes the ChatGPT engine in the backend. I’ve built [Sora by Capsule Cat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CapsuleCat.sora-by-capsule-cat) to have ChatGPT generate entire coding files for me as well with project context. Even then, I still use the ChatGPT UI as well.\n\n![Flowchart line](/media/2023-07-23-chatgpt-coding-loop/Flowchart_Template_2.jpg)\n\nI find that the above flow leaves me less fatigued, and more productive - at least in the context of side-projects that I’ve used ChatGPT. Research shows that when we read code and attempt logic puzzles, we use a completely different part of our brain than when we use language [[link](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/12/17/brain-activity-while-reading-code/)]. In the above chart, you can imagine that when we write prompts, we utilize some logical reasoning, but we lean heavily on language as we talk with ChatGPT. Then when we get a response, a completely different part of the brain kicks in to read and write code.\n\n## The Hard Part About Coding\n\nEventually this leads to “the hard part about coding” which anecdotally everyone will tell you that surprise, it isn’t the coding part. What is nice about ChatGPT though is that even though the hard part isn’t writing code, it does take time, thought, and energy.\n\nIf the hard part of coding isn’t coding, then what is it? The non-exhaustive list is that it’s teamwork, communication, debugging, and requirements gathering. Oversimplifying, it’s the writing prompts part of the chart.\n","contentHTML":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve been experimenting with ChatGPT, just like everyone else. But why has it become so popular?

We didn’t have a PC, so I had to play it on a friend’s computer, but I remember being immersed in the real-time strategy gameplay.\n\nLater, I would get a PC and bought my own copy of Starcraft. This was years later, but the community for the game was still impressive. Joining one of the older Starcraft forums, I discovered “mods” for the game. The most popular ones were just graphical changes, but that concept of changing a game to display your own graphics was so interesting to me. I’m not sure how I stumbled on it, but I found [http://www.staredit.net/](http://www.staredit.net/) (yes, it’s still active!) and I learned that you could do so much more than just change the graphics of Starcraft with mods. There were people in the community working on hooking into existing Starcraft code to modify the gameplay and graphics using C++.\n\n## Diving deep\n\nIn order to create these mods, we needed to know the hex address of different functions that Starcraft would call during them game. And to do anything meaningful, we also needed to know the structure of units and sprites and where those were stored as well. A lot of this base work required using tools like OllyDbg to analyze the assembly of the Starcraft executable, and ArtMoney for analyzing the memory of the game while it was executing.\n\nI used OllyDbg to find what functions Starcraft would call during execution – from common functions like the game-loop, to highly specialized functions like checking supply limits. ArtMoney let us determine how structures like units were laid out – where each unit’s health was stored, how much damage each weapon would do, and more.\n\nMost of this information was shared in forums, chat rooms, and a few disparate sites for looking up hex addresses. Of course, no write up about modding Starcraft is complete without mentioning all the work from ShadowFlare (check out [ShadowFlare’s realm](https://sfsrealm.hopto.org/) for all the work they did), the great people at Staredit.Net, and plenty of others who built amazing tools to work with Starcraft files. All these sites were amazing resources for figuring out file specs and working with the Starcraft engine.\n\nHowever, each time I wanted to write a new mod or experiment with an idea, I’d have to look up all of this information across all of these sites.\n\n## Bringing it together\n\nThe goal with GPTP (General Plugin Template Project), was to take all of this work that the amazing modding community had done and bring it together into a C++ Visual Studio project that could be copied for a new mod.\n\nMy initial idea was simple: take all of the code for injecting new function hooks into Starcraft and wrap it in some very friendly functions. When a modder would come in to create a new project, they would have three functions exposed to them to work with: gameStart, gameLoop, gameEnd (I don’t remember the exact names I gave them at the time).\n\nI released the initial GPTP back in 2008-2009. This included the project setup for compiling and producing a QDP file that could be loaded into Starcraft. Additionally, it contained known structures and hex addresses that developers could use to build their mod. The Intellisense autocomplete feature really helped developers leverage these structures.\n\n## The power of open source\n\nI made the original version of GPTP back in high school, but I didn’t have time to continue to work on it when I went to university. I returned to the community a decade later, and found that not only was the community still alive and working on mods, but that they were using GPTP. At this point, GPTP was unrecognizable from my original work; the goal was the same, but the quality of the code was greatly improved and the number of hooks, known structures, and addresses was much more impressive.\n\nYou can view the project on Github: [general-plugin-template-project](https://github.com/SCMapsAndMods/general-plugin-template-project).\n\nI’d like to thank open source for this sort of development. The amount of work that has been continually added onto this project couldn’t have been done without all the contributions from the community.\n\n## Does it still work?\n\nI recently went back to Starcraft modding as a fun little project. I wanted to hop in and see how easy or difficult it would be to create a mod in 2020.\n\nOne of the harder things to do in 2020 is find all the tools and initial setup for modding Starcraft. Some of the modding sites are down for good, and with them the knowledge they contained.\n\nBut, I pulled together the tools (thanks PyMS), pulled together tutorials and other instructions into a Notion document, and created my first Starcraft mod!\n\nGathering all the tools was the hard part. After that, it was actually very straightforward creating a new GPTP template and mod. All of the known structures and hooks are pretty self-explanatory and I was able to even add my own hooks once I found the hex addresses using OllyDbg.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nStarcraft modding is like an ancient art at this point. There isn’t a large audience for it, so in general, any new mod will be played by maybe 10 people. But to me, it’s a combination of nostalgia, hard work, tinkering, discovery, and creation that makes it so much fun. That feeling of finding a new function to hook onto, writing C++ code that injects itself into it, and then running the code in the Starcraft engine and seeing it work is a special kind of rewarding experience.\n\n## Thanks\n\nI’d like to give thanks to everyone who has ever contributed to the modding community for Starcraft.

I'm glad I was able to guess the object you were thinking of. It was fun playing \"Twenty Questions\" with you. Let me know if you want to play again sometime.*\n\n---\n\nI’ve been keeping an eye on how other people are using ChatGPT, and [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) is one of the more fascinating aspects around how people are communicating with the AI. Prompt engineering plays a key role in communicating with models like ChatGPT. Carefully crafting prompts can help maximize the quality of the reponse. However, it is important to keep in mind that, like any AI model, ChatGPT has its own set of limitations.\n\nSo I was curious when I read that “[ChatGPT can’t write sentences that end in a specific letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/101e454/chatgpt_cant_write_sentences_that_end_with_a/)”. Is this a real limitation of ChatGPT, or maybe this was just a poor prompt.\n\nSo let’s start with a very simple question to ChatGPT:\n\n*Me: Can you write a sentence that ends with the letter \"a\"?*\n\n*ChatGPT: The cat sat on the mat.*\n\n*Me: That sentence does not end in the letter \"a\". Can you write a sentence that ends in the letter \"a\"?*\n\n*ChatGPT: I can't think of anything right now, but the word \"America\" ends with letter \"a\".*\n\n*Me: Great, write a sentence that ends in that word. That will then satisfy the original question.*\n\n*ChatGPT: The land of the free, and the home of the brave, America.*\n\nOkay, that does technically end in the letter a, but the sentence seems very strange.\n\n*Me: That isn't a very coherent sentence. Can you write a sentence that ends in the letter \"a\"?*\n\n*ChatGPT: I am sorry for the confusion, here is a sentence that ends with the letter \"a\" - \"He saw the drama unfold on the stage, it was quite the spectacle, a.”*\n\nLooks like we are going off the rails here. Let’s try a different approach:\n\n*Me: Write a sentence that ends in a word that ends with the letter \"a\".*\n\n*ChatGPT: The sun was setting over the horizon, painting the sky with shades of orange and red, a spectacle to behold and end the day with.*\n\nI’m going to ask ChatGPT to tell me a prompt to feed back to itself. I’ve found this useful for resetting context when having long conversations. Or if ChatGPT gets into weird states like the above response.\n\n*Me: Can you tell me how to write a prompt for you that would actually get you to write a sentence that ends in the letter \"a\".*\n\n*ChatGPT: Sure, to get me to write a sentence that ends in the letter \"a\" you could provide a prompt like: \"Write a sentence that ends with a word that ends with the letter 'a'\" or \"Can you write a sentence with a word ending in 'a' at the end of the sentence?\" . This makes it clear that the sentence should end in a word ending with the letter 'a'.*\n\n*Me: Can you write a sentence with a word ending in 'a' at the end of the sentence?*\n\n*ChatGPT: The sky was clear and blue, not a cloud in sight, perfect for a day out at the parka.*\n\n---\n\nWhile ChatGPT is great at forming sentences and even code, it seems like it has no understanding and hasn’t been trained on letters, syllables, or the concept of sentences. I've seen others get ChatGPT to create poems, but it has no concept of why words would rhyme. It can give great answers to questions, but doesn’t understand how to count how many words are in its response.\n\nOne Redditor in the link above mentions that ChatGPT fails at ASCII art. I’ve tried getting the AI to print ASCII art before, and I’ll leave you with part of a conversation I’ve had with it. This appears to be the best ASCII art I could get it to print, even after having a long conversation where I provided different ASCII art examples:\n\n*Me: Can you make ASCII art? Show me a picture of a cat.*\n\n*ChatGPT: Sure! Here is a picture of a cat using ASCII art:*\n\n```\n /\\_/\\\n( o.o )\n \u003e^\u003c\n\n```\n\n*I hope you like it! Is there anything else I can help with?*\n\n*Me: Can you make it more detailed*\n\n*ChatGPT: Certainly! Here is a more detailed version of an ASCII art cat:*\n\n```\n /\\_/\\\n( o.o )\n  \u003e^\u003c\n  | |\n  || ||\n  \\\\ //\n  // \\\\\n  \\\\_//\n  /   \\\n /     \\\n\n```\n\nWith new language models coming out, it's important to recognize what the limitations\nof the AI are. Poor responses can be a result of poorly written prompts, but there\nare times, like with letters in words with ChatGPT, where the AI just doesn't have\nthe capability to understand the question.\n","contentHTML":"\u003cp\u003eLooks like everyone is trying to discover ChatGPT’s limitations.

Then the consumer can send a new utterance get a label using that model.\n\nThe NLP APIs at Clarity Hub were a set of APIs:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph RL\n  NLP(Clarity Hub NLP API) --\u003e API(Clarity Hub Infer API) --\u003e Consumer\n```\n\nThe Consumer would user the Infer API which provided APIs for training and labeling datasets and getting toxicity and sentiment analyses. the Clarity Hub NLP API contained trained Tensorflow datasets for creating embeddings via the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE).\n\nAn **embedding** a vector that represents an utterance - a sentence, sentence fragment, or paragraph of text.\n\nTraining would involve a consumer sending a payload of utterances with labels to the Infer API, which would call the NLP API internally to create embeddings. We then clustered these embeddings to and re-labelled the clusters using the given labels. If no label was found for an utterance cluster, we attempted to pull a topic out of the utterances to re-label it.\n\nThe clusters with labels were then stored into S3.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  Train --\u003e|Utterances with labels| USE\n  USE --\u003e|Embeddings with labels| Clustering\n  Clustering --\u003e|Embedding Clusters| Labeller\n  Labeller --\u003e|Clusters with Labels| S3\n```\n\nTo classify a new utterance, we created an embedding from it, loaded the existing dataset in, then ran cosine similarity to find the most probabilistic matches:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  Classify --\u003e |Utterance| USE\n  USE --\u003e |Embedding| Classifier(Classifier)\n  Classifier --\u003e |Embedding + Clusters from S3| Similarity(Cosine Similarity)\n  Similarity --\u003e |Labels with Probability| Response\n```\n\n### What it looked like\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-01-07 at 3.57.56 PM.png](/media/2023-01-07-clarity-hub-infer/Screen_Shot_2023-01-07_at_3.57.56_PM.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-01-07 at 3.58.08 PM.png](/media/2023-01-07-clarity-hub-infer/Screen_Shot_2023-01-07_at_3.58.08_PM.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-01-07 at 3.58.28 PM.png](/media/2023-01-07-clarity-hub-infer/Screen_Shot_2023-01-07_at_3.58.28_PM.png)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith ChatGPT and other NLP models coming out lately, this seems fairly basic, but the following processes are still very useful to understand:\n\n- Convert language to a representation that is easier to work with, like a vector.\n- Clustering vectors is a great way to find representative vectors, reducing the size of the number of vectors you need to work with.\n- Cosine Similarity can be used to find how similar vectors are.
