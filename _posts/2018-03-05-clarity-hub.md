Clarity Hub finds the best answers that have worked in the past and suggests them to teams using Intercom when answering similar questions.

Clarity Hub was built on AWS using S3, SNS, SQS, RDS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and React. We created a webapp, extensions, and a microservice backend to bring real time suggestions to customer success agents using Intercom.
