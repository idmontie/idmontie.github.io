Space Kitty is a way of making projects.

The goal is to help you get from 0 to initial prototype and MVP as fast as possible.

Instead of wasting time learning about best practices, how to set up your router, get views set up correctly, browsing for the correct packages to use, and writing the same scaffolding code over and over again, Space Kitty takes care of all of that for you.
