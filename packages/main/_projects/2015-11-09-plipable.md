I made Plipable to be a fun way to interact with videos.

Thanks to Youtube, there are tons of videos to watch and comment on. Special thanks to their API which made this all possible.

Shout out to Giphy. I just really, really like Giphy. Without them, commenting just would not be as fun as it is.
