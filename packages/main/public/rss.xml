            <description><![CDATA[<p>Maintaining growing software is challenging. Poorly architected APIs and
incorrect abstractions can significantly impact the ability for engineering
teams to deliver new features in a timely manner. If we consider an
API&#x27;s complixty as being a significant contributor to its overhead,
maintainability, and ease of use, then it becomes a question of how
do we best measure this complexity so that we can make informed decisions
about how to refactor and improve our APIs.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every system has its limits. When designing and architecting systems, sometimes we as engineers like to assume things can scale infinitely. Maybe we can use larger machines, or maybe we can deploy more instances of a service. But even trying to scale systems isn’t magically infinite. It’s a smart move to understand the limitations of what we are building upfront so we can make better technology choices, and squeeze the performance out of our existing systems.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A common pattern in larger application when trying to track feature usage is to try to namespace events. For example, you might have a button that you want to track clicks on. For the sake of this article, we will use the <code>data-track</code> attribute on elements to track their usage, but you can imagine this works with any tracking implementation where you may need to explicitly call a tracking function (e.g. <code>track(namespace)</code>).</p>]]></description>
