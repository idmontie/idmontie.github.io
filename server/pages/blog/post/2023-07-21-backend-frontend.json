The recent divorce of browser code being rendered by backend services was created by SPAs - Single Page Applications. In simpler architectures, a SPA and service could be as simple as:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  SPA --> Backend\n```\n\nSPAs also became popular because the codebase could be built into static assets that could be services.\n\nHowever, as complexity arises with the above architecture and the SPA starts to rely on more services, a thin proxy is typically introduced, like NGINX:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  SPA --> NGINX\n  NGINX --> Service1\n  NGINX --> Service2\n  NGINX --> Service3\n```\n\nWhile proxies like NGINX can continue to be useful, using it as a proxy ends up putting a lot of routing and additional API handling logic on the client. The client now ends up also having to support, understand, and embed how to interact with the data rom all the downstream services. To simplify and create consistent contracts with the UI, we can create a proxy service: a Backend for the Frontend:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  SPA --> BEFFE\n  BEFFE --> Service1\n  BEFFE --> Service2\n  BEFFE --> Service3\n```\n\nThe Backend for the Frontend ends up serving two purposes:\n\n- It acts as a proxy for all UI requests\n- It manages and massages the APIs of downstream services to be a consistent API for the UI.\n\nWhen building a UI, only a single service that acts like an API Gateway is required to understand and encode within the application.\n\nThe Backend for the Frontend model also allows engineers working on services to separate logic for the UI with the logic from an internal service. An internal service can rely on the Backend for the Frontend to handle things like Authentication, Authorization, Caching, and Rate-limits.
