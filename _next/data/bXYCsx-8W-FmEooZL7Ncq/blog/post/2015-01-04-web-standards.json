This post goes into using web standards and best practices.\n\n## Check that GET and POST Requests are Used Properly\n\n`GET` request should be for requesting information.\n\n`POST` requests should be for sending information.\n\nA `GET` request should not change the object that is being requests.\n\n## Validate your HTML and CSS\n\nWrite your [XHTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) or [HTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/) and [CSS](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) according to [the W3C specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/) and make sure they [validate](http://validator.w3.org/).\n\nAvoid browser quirks modes by doing this.\n\n## Use 301 and 302 Redirects Correctly\n\nAccording to [Bigoak Inc](http://www.bigoakinc.com/blog/when-to-use-a-301-vs-302-redirect/):\n\n> All three major search engines handle 301 redirects the same, that is to say they ignore the original URL and instead index the destination URL.\n\n> The three major engines handle 302 redirects very differently, and because of this 302s are typically not recommended.\n\nBest practice is to use 301 redirects (which are permanent and are usually cached by the browser).  For temporary moves, use 302 redirects.\n\n## Force IE to Use Unicode for Parameters\n\nIf you have ever seen `utf8=✓` in the parameter listing of a url, it's in order to [force Internet Explorer (5, 6, 7 and 8) to encode its parameters as unicode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3222013/what-is-the-snowman-param-in-ruby-on-rails-3-forms-for/3348524#3348524).  \n","contentHTML":"<p>This post was originally on a blog I started for creating web applications.

This post goes into User Interface design for web applications.\n\nUser Experience is one of the most important parts of web applications.\n\nThe following are tips and questions to consider when working on your web application user interface.\n\n## Test for Consistency Between Browsers\n\nAre there tests for consistency with:\n\n- [ ] The [Gecko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28layout_engine%29) engine - i.e. [Firefox](http://firefox.com/).\n- [ ] The Webkit engine - i.e. [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/).\n- [ ] [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).\n- [ ] [Opera](http://www.opera.com/).\n- [ ] IE Browsers - take advantage of the [Application Compatibility VPC Images](http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=21eabb90-958f-4b64-b5f1-73d0a413c8ef&displaylang=en).\n\nFor IE Browsers, there is a Github project call [ievms](https://github.com/xdissent/ievms) which provides Virtual Machines with IE6, IE7, IE8, IE8, IE10, and IE11.\n\nAlso consider how the same browser will render your site on differnet operating systems. Consider a service like [Browsershots](http://www.browsershots.org/) or [Litmus](https://litmus.com/).\n\n## Do your Positive, Negative, and Neutral Buttons look different?\n\nImage from [UX Movement](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/how-button-color-contrast-guides-users-to-action/).\n\nHave your Positive Action buttons and your Neutral and Negative Action buttons look distinctly different.  Notice that in the above example, not only are the colors different, but one is bordered and ther other is filled in, making it accessible to those with color-blindness.\n\n## Test for Mobile Consistency\n\nAre there tests for consistency with:\n\n- [ ] Android phones and tablets\n- [ ] iOS phones and tablets\n- [ ] Screen readers\n- [ ] Search engines\n\nFor more information, check out Mobile and Developer Tools.\n\n## Do you have a staging environment?\n\nCan you deploy updates without affecting your users?\n\nTesting and staging environments are important for being able to test features, architecture, etc without breaking the user's session.\n\nHave an automated way of deploying approved changes to the live site. Consider using a version control system with an automated build system (something like [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)).\n\n## Are errors handled in a friendly matter?\n\nUsers should receive easy to read error messages.\n\nUsers should never see:\n\n- Out Of Memory errors\n- Raw 404 pages\n- Stack Traces\n\n## Is user info crawlable on public pages?\n\nTry not to have users' email in plain text on public facing pages.  They might get spammed.\n\n## Is the `rel=\"nofollow\"` attribute on user-generated links?\n\nAvoid spam by putting the [nofollow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow) on user generated links.\n\n## Does your site have built in rate limiting and velocity checking?\n\nAny user actions should have rate limiting and velocity checking built in.  This is also a security issue.\n\nLook into [Coding Horror's post on rate limiting and velocity checking](http://blog.codinghorror.com/rate-limiting-and-velocity-checking/) for more information.\n\n## No inline styles\n\nAll CSS should be in stylesheets.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nCheck to make sure your website is navigable from screen readers.\n\nIf you are using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), look into the [Bootstrap accessibility plugin](http://paypal.github.io/bootstrap-accessibility-plugin/).\n\nIf you are using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), look into how [Foundation is built around accessibility](http://zurb.com/article/1337/foundation-now-helps-you-build-accessible).\n\nFor more on accessibility, see the full page on Accessibility.\n\n## Are you using HTML5?\n\nIf you can, start out by using HTML5.  If you do so, remember to include the [HTML5 Shiv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv) (or Shim) so that IE version before 9 can use HTML5 elements.\n\nLook into [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) or [Initialzr](http://www.initializr.com/) for an HTML5 boilerplate that comes with the HTML5 shim, normalize.css, and Modernizr.\n\n## Consider Using Normalize.css\n\nConsider reseting the browser style sheets or using [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for consistency between browsers.\n\n## Are you using Semantic HTML?\n\nRecent HTML standards discourage the use of the `<i>` in preference for the `<em>` tag. Other HTML5 tas to consider using are:\n\n- `<article>`\n- `<aside>`\n- `<details>`\n- `<figcaption>`\n- `<figure>`\n- `<footer>`\n- `<header>`\n- `<main>`\n- `<mark>`\n- `<nav>`\n- `<section>`\n- `<summary>`\n- `<time>`\n\n## Redirect after a POST\n\nAfter a user POSTs data, redirect to a success page, to prevent a refresh from submitting data again.\n\n## Use Progressive Enhancement\n\nAllow graceful degradation of your website.\n\n- [ ] Basic content should be accessible to all web browsers\n- [ ] Basic functionality should be accessible to all web browsers\n- [ ] Sparse, semantic markup contains all content\n- [ ] Enhanced layout is provided by externally linked CSS\n- [ ] Enhanced behavior is provided by unobtrusive, externally linked JavaScript\n- [ ] End-user web browser preferences are respected\n\nSee [Progressive Enhancement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) for more information.\n\n## Validate Forms\n\nGoing along with Security, make sure to validate all form input on the server side and give useful errors back to the user.  Once proper form security handling has been implemented, add in client side validation.  You can use HTML5's simple validation to add a small layer of responsive validation:\n\n```html\n<input id=\"username\" placeholder=\"John Jones\" required>\n```\n\nYou can use the `required` attribute to let users know on the client side before they submit their form that a field is required.\n\nYou can use the new input type to help with input validation as well:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"email\" required>\n```\n\nYou can mark invalid input with CSS as well:\n\n```css\ninput:required:invalid {\n  background: red;\n}\n```\n\nCheckout [Form Validation in HTML 5](http://basicuse.net/articles/pl/textile/html_css/form_validation_in_html5) for more information.\n\n## Use CSS Animations over JavaScript Animations\n\nYou can now use CSS animations instead of relying on JavaScript.  You can read more about CSS animations on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_animations).\n\n## Look at Little Big Details\n\n[Little Big Details](http://littlebigdetails.com/) contains design inspiration from the point of view of the users.\n\nFor more websites about UI, look at our developer tools list.\n\n## Responsive Grids\n\nHaving a responsve layout is great for creating one application that looks good on mobile and desktop devices.  A Responsive Layout can be achieved by using popular frameworks like:\n\n- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)\n- [SemanticUI](http://semantic-ui.com/)\n- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)\n\nand more.\n\nYou can also create a custom grid if the above frameworks are too large for you to use.  Check out [this tutorial on Minimal Responsive Grids](http://jordanlev.github.io/grid/).\n","contentHTML":"<p>This post was originally on a blog I started for creating web applications.

This post goes into security for web applications.\n\n## Prevent Against SQL Injection\n\nRead about [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) and learn how to prevent it for the langauge and database you are using.\n\n## All User Input is Filtered\n\nNever trust user input.  This includes cookies and hidden form field values.\n\n## Read the Open Web Application Security Project\n\nRead [the Open Web Application Security Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project).\n\n## All Passwords are Hashed with a Salt\n\nHash all passwords using a [salt](http://security.stackexchange.com/q/21263/396) and all salts are different to prevent against [rainbow attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table).\n\nThe hashing algorithm should be bcrypt or scrypt for storing passwords.  Look into [How To Safely Sroe a Password](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/).\n\nDo **not** use MD5 or any SHA algorithm.  SHA algorithms are meant to be fast, which should not be used for trying to securely store passwords.\n\n## Use a Standard Authentication System\n\nDo not role your own authentication system.\n\n## Process Credit Card Information Correctly\n\nLook into the [PCI Security Standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) for financial security information.\n\n## Use HTTPS for Sensitive Data\n\nSet up your [SSL](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ssl/draft302.txt)/[HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) certs correctly and check it against [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).\n\n## Prevent Session Hijacking\n\nBuilt in session systems are usually premade to handle these types of attacks. It is not recommended that you roll your own, but it should have the following features:\n\n- Encrypted data traffic.  The session key in particular should be encrypted, but ideally all traffic should be encrypted by using SSL/TLS.\n- Long random session key.  Attackers should not be able to guess valid session keys.\n- Regenerating the session id after a successful login.  Prevents [session fixation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation].\n- Change the cookie value with each and every request.  This reduces the window for an attacker to hijack the session.\n\n## Prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\n\nUnfiltered query parameters that are added to the DOM are an easy way for attackers to use cross site scripting to pull data from your users.  Filter all query parameters; see [Cross-site Scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) for more information on common attacks and prevention methods.\n\n## Prevent Page Embedding\n\nYou can prevent page embedding with the following header:\n\n```\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\n```\n\nThis will cause browsers to refuse requests for framing in that page.\n\nYou can also prevent page embedding with JavaScript to prevent users from accessing your website in an iframe.  Look into this [StackOverflow solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7776281/javascript-jquery-how-to-detect-if-a-page-is-embedded-by-others).\n\n## Prevent Cross Site Request Forgeries\n\nCross site request forgeries are attacks by a malicious user whereby they craft a link to a site which a user is know to have been authenticated.  For example, say your site is a bank website; the malicious user may craft a URL for you site that when a user clicks on it, deposits money into the attacker's account.  The attacker then sends the link to users who may have been logged into your bank website.\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery):\n\n> At risk are web applications that perform actions based on input from trusted and authenticated users without requiring the user to authorize the specific action. A user who is authenticated by a cookie saved in the user's web browser could unknowingly send an HTTP request to a site that trusts the user and thereby causes an unwanted action.\n\n## Prevent Click Jacking\n\nSimilar to [Page Embedding](#prevent-page-embedding), click jacking works by:\n\n> A user might receive an email with a link to a video about a news item, but another valid page, say a product page on Amazon.com, can be \"hidden\" on top or underneath the \"PLAY\" button of the news video. The user tries to \"play\" the video but actually \"buys\" the product from Amazon.\n\nOther known exploits include:\n\n- Tricking users into enabling their webcam and microphone through Flash\n- Tricking users into making their social networking profile information public\n- Making users follow someone on Twitter[8]\n- Sharing links on Facebook\n\nSee [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) for more information.\n\n## Verify That Server Software is Up to Date\n\nMake sure that the software on your system is up to date with the latest patches.\n\n## Verify That Packages, Modules, Plugins, etc are Up to Date\n\nMake sure that the latest software used by your projest is up to date with the latest patches.\n\n## Verify That Your Database is Secured\n\nMake sure that connections to the database are at least password protected.  Verify that only the least amount of permissions are being used.\n\nMake sure that confidential information is encrypted or hashed.\n\n## Attempt to Make Your App Run As Non-Root\n\nApply [the principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and try to have your app run as non-root as often as possible.\n\n## Use the Content-Security-Policy Header\n\nSpecify the following header to make the browser only run certain content depending on its origin:\n\n**example**\n\n```\nContent-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com\n```\n\nYou can also specify the following type of content:\n\n- script-src (JavaScript)\n- connect-src (XMLHttpRequest, WebSockets, and EventSource)\n- font-src (Fonts)\n- frame-src (Frame Urls)\n- img-src (Images)\n- media-src (Audio and Videos)\n- object-src (Flash)\n- style-src (CSS)\n\n## Do Not Allow Mime Sniffing with User Uploaded Content\n\nYou can tell browsers to not try to guess Mime Types of files with the following header:\n\n```\nX-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS: nosniff\n```\n\nFor example, say a user uploads an HTML file. You intend to serve it to users as a text file, but the browser will attempt to serve it as an HTML page.  You can tell the browser that you know what you are doing and that the Mime Type you are providing is indeed correct by using the above header.\n\n## Force HTTPS Traffic\n\nYou can force HTTPS Traffic with the following header:\n\n```\nScrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n```\n\nThis will force `https://website.com` even when typing in `http://website.com`\n","contentHTML":"<p>This post was originally on a blog I started for creating web applications.
