This was a startup I did with a group of friends where we aimed to create software to enable software product teams to gather customer feedback, and then action on it.\n\nI’ve been thinking about rebooting Clarity Hub for some time. When I was devoting my time to the Clarity Hub startup, the offering was split into two parts: 1. Interviewing software for product teams, and 2. an AI and NLP set of APIs for inference and predictions.\n\nWe ended up open sourcing as much of our Clarity Hub code as we could: [Clarity Hub on Github](https://github.com/Clarityhub). This included all of our original code pivots as well. While interviewing with a few startups, a couple asked me for details on Clarity Hub and how we approached the problem domain, architectural decisions, and software design. All these notes ended up as part of the README: [Architecture notes on Github](https://github.com/clarityhub/clarityhub-server-core).\n\nLooking at all these diagrams, seeing all the incredible work I did with my small team on Clarity Hub, I can see that a lot has changed since we tackled this problem.\n\nThe first major change is that Notion has become a common name in note-taking. I consider myself an early adopter of Notion and have referred many friends over to it. Clarity Hub as a Notion for Product Teams seems very useless now, especially with the second change in consideration.\n\nThe second major change being how far AI and NLP came within just a few years. Focusing on this as our differentiator is now irrelevant. Notion has released their API, new AI tools, and a plethora of other features. And while Notion doesn’t provide an easy way to record, video call, automatically transcribe meetings, and pull topics from conversations, this seems pretty trivial to add as a Notion extension. I think Dovetail will be in the same boat. As OpenAI continues to provide more powerful models, and makes them easy to use, well positioned apps like Notion will be able to continue to get better.\n\nBut not is all lost, part of failing as a start-up is at least learning a lot.\n\n## Microservices, but not really\n\nLooking back on our startup adventure, one thing I’d recommend for a new business just trying to start out is to think about microservices, but not fully committing to the complexity of microservices. We approached this by making the entire application in Serverless, using lambdas for each main endpoint that was needed as lambdas to handle asynchronous services. This let us share code, but move quickly.\n\n## Billing\n\nBilling is one of those items that can easily become a time-sync – and it did. Looking back, I feel like we wasted so much time, effort, and thought on billing. If I had to do Clarity Hub over again, I’d ignore billing for just Free Trial and Contact Sales for custom billing.\n\nWithout customers, there’s no point in building a billing system, especially when you don’t know what type of customers you will have.\n\nWe definitely learned a lot about Stripe and how to build in eventing into our systems to help support billing cycles, upgrading, and more.\n\nWe also spent very little time looking into alternative billing providers, since we were part of Stripe Atlas. One that has always interested me was Lago, since it is available as Open Source and a hosted solution.\n\n## Conflict-free replicated data types\n\nWe originally used Slate for our editor, and as is usual in programming, they went through a major version bump right after we finished our original implementation. I wish we had investigated Conflict-free replicated data types for this more and built-in real-time multi-user editing for notes early in the development stage.\n\nImplementing a basic solution for this would have been well worth it from a learning perspective, and from a code-reusability perspective. As is, a lot of the editor code is obsolete and tightly coupled with the specific version of slate that we used.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf I could do Clarity Hub all over again, I would. It was a great learning and growing experience for me, and I’ve often looked back on what we did and thought about rebooting Clarity Hub. But when I look around the current technology landscape, I think the scope of the product and its main differentiators would have to change dramatically.\n","contentHTML":"<p>In my projects list on this blog is a set of projects related to Clarity Hub.

We can however use utility types that simulate opaque types, like the Opaque definition in [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest):\n\n```tsx\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgeTAQwI4FcCmcC+cAZlBCHAOQwCeYOAtETgM4wUDcAUJzXXADIQAxmgA2wAF44AJgGUYUYADsA5nAC8KdNhwAeCoJHipchcpUUANHFaLVAPnZA)\n\nHere is a short example where we create a localized string and try to use a raw string and our localized string in a function:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n\nfunction createLocalizedString(s: string): LocalizedString {\n    return s as LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction example(s: LocalizedString) {\n    return s;\n}\n\nconsole.log(example('test')); // Will throw a type error\nconsole.log(example(createLocalizedString('test'))); // Works correctly\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgeTAQwI4FcCmcC+cAZlBCHAOQwCeYOAtETgM4wUDcAUJzXXADIQAxmgA2wAF44AJgGUYUYADsA5nAC8KdNhwAeCoJHipchcpUUANHFaLVAPi6ciWJUJjAISuEKg40MDiGYpIy8nYqABTMAFw2ZqoAlHHBxmEJagiccDlwfjBYUN7McGglqaGmEVz43C5uHl5wOAAeaOCiONEpwiEm4eaJiNm5+YXFNdxCXswQnQB0ohBRre1gnZFULGyJiVzTSrMLSyttHV2+-oEV-RmbgawUu3tAA)\n\nNow we have a type that we can use in our function and components to denote that we expect an already localized string to be used.\n\n## Enforcing in Components\n\nThe simplest way we can enforce that strings have already been localized is by using the type in our component’s props interface:\n\n```tsx\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction Button(props: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\n}\n```\n\nNow if we try to use that component without a localized string, we get an error:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n\nfunction createLocalizedString(s: string): LocalizedString {\n    return s as LocalizedString;\n}\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction Button(props: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\n}\n\nfunction Example() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <Button label=\"Test\" />\n            <Button label={createLocalizedString(\"Test\")} />\n        </>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAJQKYEMDG8BmUIjgcilQ3wG4AoUSWOAbzgHkwUBHAVyTgF85tcCYATzBIAtJiQBnGGXLkhIuABkIaFABtgALyQATAMowowAHYBzOAF5GzdkgA8+FWs06DR02fwAaONOPmAHwU5JhsJhjAECZwaEQoMEjOGtp6hgFmABSSAFx+HuYAlHnJrmkFFrTkcDVwRDBsUDGScCgtpanuGRRccqaJUJjonABCbDAw0QAKOGAtVTXqKABGSOolqilu6Z49cmERMFExYxPRmWCzuXCnkyYzEHOFdNV1SA1NcPbL43eBtJdHpIAHRLVbqLj2AD0PzOJmC5F6oXCkWicAAogAPFDgdRITLPBa1eqNGKZV61Wr2QIUyl0+y3NFgtaWABEABUpDBWXAoTS6QKvoyYsz1JZaHFUIkOtsKpkOVzWYUeHzaZTofzaoUekA)\n\n## Localizing Strings\n\nSo far, we’ve been using a utility `createLocalizedString` to create and use the LocalizedString type. This utility is only really practical in unit tests. For real applications, we’ll want to use a translation function from [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) or [next-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next) to do the heavy lifting. Then we just wrap the translation functions that are provided in order to use our type:\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\nimport { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n\nfunction createLocalizedString(s: string): LocalizedString {\n    return s as LocalizedString;\n}\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction Button(props: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\n}\n\nfunction useLocalizedTranslation() {\n    const { t : originalTranslate } = useTranslation();\n\n    const t = useCallback((key: string, defaultString: string) => {\n        return originalTranslate(key, defaultString) as LocalizedString;\n    }, [originalTranslate]);\n\n    return { t };\n}\n\nfunction Example() {\n    const { t } = useLocalizedTranslation();\n    return (\n        <>\n            <Button label={t(\"test\", \"Test\")} />\n        </>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#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-EglBg8gFHAwKYAIiG+if2CfFj0MCfSyYHJPM9zwAucdwYIA)\n\nHere we use `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` and wrap the `t` translation function that is returned to override the type it gives us.\n\nNow when engineers go to use the Button component, they will know they need a LocalizedString, and the most straightforward way to get it will be to use the i18next utilities that we also provide.\n","contentHTML":"<p>When building web applications, enforcing that strings be localized to the user’s preferred language can sometimes be achieved via lint rules.
