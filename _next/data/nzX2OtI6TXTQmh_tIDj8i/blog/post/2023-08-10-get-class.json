Smart Contracts that try to be too clever often have unintended side-effects or functionality.

Many Smart Contracts will have many small functions that can be composed together, rather than one large function that does everything. This helps keep the code readable, making it easier to understand and secure.\n\n## Linting\n\nLint your code. Smart Contracts written in Solidity have tools already written that can help catch common errors via linting. The easiest linters to set up just help improve formatting, but some can help you write more secure code by letting your know when functions have been deprecated or marked as insecure.\n\n## Unit Tests\n\nUnit test your code.

One way is to use [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither):\n\n```tsx\nnpm install slither\nslither .\n```\n\nThis may take a while to run, but it will scan the compiles contracts for security issues.\n\n## Compliance\n\nFor Ethereum Smart Contracts, you can also use [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) to check the compliance of your ERC20 token or ERC721 contracts. Running this check will verify that your contract implements the expected interfaces of the given contracts.\n\n## Wrapping it Up\n\nSecurity is a major consideration in any application, but Smart Contracts pose a new type of attack vector for malicious users.

It is almost always easier to write `{...a, ...b}` inline and have its meaning be more clear.\n\nNext we have merge, not to be confused with extend:\n\n```tsx\n/**\n * Create a new object that returns all the properties of target and props, but the properties\n * in target are left alone.\n */\nfunction merge<T extends object, P extends object>(target: T, props: P): T & P {\n    return {...props, ...target};\n}\n```\n\nSame thing here, even with a more type-safe implementation, it’s almost always more clear to have an inline spread of `{...b, ...a}`.\n\nA more interesting function implementation is `restrict`:\n\n```tsx\n/**\n * Create a new object that returns all the values in target that also exist in props.\n */\nfunction restrict<P extends object, T extends P>(target: T, props: P): Pick<T, keyof P> {\n    const t: Partial<T> = { ...target };\n\n    for (let key in target) {\n        if (!(key in props)) {\n            delete t[key];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return t as Pick<T, keyof P>;\n}\n\nconst obj1 = { a: 123, b: 222 };\nconst obj2 = { b: 0 };\n\nconsole.log(restrict(obj1, obj2)); // { b: 222 }\n```\n\nHere we end up cloning our target object in order to delete keys from it later. An alternative approach might be to only construct the object with keys in props in the first place. This implementation is at least type-safe and will give you the correct typings for the object returned from `restrict`.\n\nLastly, here is our type-safe version of `subtract`:\n\n```tsx\n/**\n * Create a new object that returns all the values in target that do not exist in props.\n */\nfunction subtract<T extends object, P extends object>(target: T, props: P): Omit<T, keyof P> {\n    const t: Partial<T> = { ...target };\n\n    for (let key in props) {\n        if (key in t) {\n            delete t[key as unknown as keyof T];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return t as Omit<T, keyof P>;\n}\n\nconsole.log(subtract(obj1, obj2)); // { a: 123 }\n```\n\nBoth the `restrict` and `subtract` make use of type assertions to tell the compiler we know the actual types of the objects and keys when we are removing keys. Without these assertions, `t` is still a `Partial<T>`, even after we delete the keys from the object.\n\n## Takeaway\n\nIt’s almost always more clear and more type-safe to merge objects using inline spread notation than trying to use a clever utility. There are cases though, like `restrict` and `subtract` where we can leverage the type system to write safer code. There is always a balance to find when trying to write utilities between making something easier for engineers, and adding additional compile time safety.\n","contentHTML":"<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rV5Xov\">“JavaScript: The Definitive Guide”</a>, there are functions described in <strong>6.5 Enumerating Properties</strong> that probably shouldn’t be used in production code because they modify their input parameters: <code>extend</code>, <code>merge</code>, <code>restrict</code>, and <code>subtract</code>.</p>\n<p>Let’s re-create each one using more modern practices in Typescript that don’t modify the input parameters:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-auto rounded bg-gray-200 p-4 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100\"><pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">/**\n * Create a new object that returns the properties of target, overwritten with the properties in props\n */\nfunction extend&lt;T extends object, P extends object&gt;(target: T, props: P): T &amp; P {\n    return {...target, ...props};\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Even in a more modern implementation, I would never recommend this.
