The goal with Sora was to enable a developer to thoughtfully write a comment about the code they would like the AI to write, and then commit to it – rather than the real-time typeahead that Github Copilot provides.\n\nWith that goal in mind, Sora provides two ways to activate OpenAI: by typing `@OpenAI` (formally `@ChatGPT`) or clicking “Send to OpenAI” when hovering over a comment. The other improvement is that Sora will read any relative link references to files in your project. A great way to use this is to have OpenAI write code in the style that already exists in your project, for example:\n\n```tsx\n/**\n * Write tests for [my-file](./my-file.ts] using\n * [other-test](../something/other-file.test.ts) as an example\n */\n```\n\nUsing this extension lets users write specifications as comments, and have ChatGPT write the entire file for you.\n\n![Sora Preview](/media/2023-06-06-sora/sora-preview.gif)\n\nThis extension leverages the OpenAI API to send any referenced files and a starting prompt to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` chat completion endpoint. The prompt mainly sets the context for creating working code using a given language and reference files.\n\nOnce the response comes back, the extension parses it and appends it to the original file.\n\n## **Installation and Usage**\n\nYou can install the extension by going to [the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CapsuleCat.sora-by-capsule-cat), or searching for “Sora” in Visual Studio Code extensions.\n\nOnce installed, you will need to enter your own OpenAI API key.
