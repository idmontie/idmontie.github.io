JavaScript defines a method `Object.create` that creates a new object using the given argument as the prototype of that object. Translating the examples from The Definitive Guide to Typescript, it looks like:\n\n```tsx\nfunction inherit<T extends object>(obj: T): T {\n    return Object.create(obj);\n}\n\nclass MyObject {\n    public a: number;\n\n    constructor(a: number) {\n        this.a = a;\n    }\n}\nconst myObject = new MyObject(123);\nconst myClone = inherit(myObject);\n```\n\n[Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABDMALApgJxlAPAFUXQA8p0wATAZ0TgCMArdaAPgAp6GAuRfASh6EA3gChE4xJnRQQmJAHlGzKADoIUgIZkOjPgG4RAXxEiIAGw1UaAWQCeiptESiJiAA4g6ZmBEQaeYCAAtnRYBmISEAhUUJgg0HCYbP6IgSFYfM4RruJQqDBUKhqIALx+Bq7GxlFgMYhB9kpOZWDoAO6Idg7KbACMAEwAzPqm0VD1tgDCZgjopchoWDhsDd3QI6O1cGboKjMA5iuNjlD6iAD0585+PAODiNXR27sHR9OzZ5fOj1s7e3CHBrvVoLGIaSDoODATrHZSfK6xEDoERAA)\n\nHowever, we lied. Notice that in the above code, the `myClone` object was created without `a` being initialized.\n\n```tsx\nconsole.log(myObject); // { a: 123 }\nconsole.log(myClone); // {}\nconsole.log(myClone instanceof MyObject); // true\n```\n\nThis creates what is known as a *type-hole*: the Typescript compiler will not report any bugs when we try to use `myClone.a`.  That’s because we used `Object.create` which returns the `any` type. In the above example, if we tried to use `myClone.a` in a case where we expected a `number`, but got `undefined`, we can end up with runtime bugs that should have been caught by the compiler.\n\nWe can make the typings a little more clear by doing the following:\n\n```tsx\nfunction inherit<T extends object>(obj: T): Partial<T> {\n    return Object.create(obj);\n}\n```\n\nNow Typescript will report that the value of `myClone.a` might be undefined.\n\nLet’s improve this a bit more and create an object that inherits and freezes the data in the given object:\n\n```tsx\nfunction inheritAndFreeze<T extends object>(obj: T, values: Partial<T>): Readonly<Partial<T>> {\n    const properties: PropertyDescriptorMap = {};\n\n    Object.keys(obj).forEach((unsafeKey) => {\n        const key = unsafeKey as keyof T;\n        properties[key] = {\n            value: values[key] ?? undefined,\n            writable: false,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfigurable: false,\n        };\n    })\n\n    return Object.create(obj, properties);\n}\n\nclass MyObject {\n    public a: number;\n\n    constructor(a: number) {\n        this.a = a;\n    }\n}\n\nconst myObject = new MyObject(123);\nconst myClone = inheritAndFreeze(myObject, { a: 123 });\n\nconsole.log(myClone); // { a: 123 }\nmyClone.a = 999; // Would throw \"Cannot assign to read only property 'a' of object '#<MyObject>' \"\n```\n\n[Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?ssl=29&ssc=102&pln=1&pc=1#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABDMALApgJxlAgmAEwDFN10AvdAHgBVF0APKdQgZ0TgCMArdaAPgAUXbgC5ENADSIAbgEMANiHStxABTmZYi2vwCU4gEro5BBAoCeVDVpg6a-fogDeAKEQfEEBKyiIADphw-liwKupBIVoWACIqENj+UHCYALJy-ogAvC4AvgDcru6eAPI8fFAAdADW6Baswjx6lcApAKJyEKiCguCscsDoANJ1etlObp5TXj5+tRbZiH0Dw3WIcuzzcMAShdOegcGhMCoA2vMAuouT+9PySuji98qs53VXAPwfS4TowCjoAiSYq3TwAd2wUDknAUj0QwEUrHQwIAkGj0d4wP8AOYgTDQ2HiBEKJHA0EFEGIXJ6IpTUhQPFIMq8aCVBImZiNbjSQ5RMKsPSFXJFCAKDbsVIWZkVFyU-wgGEwCDrcRgEAAW04WEKlMxvkwIGgKUEclVGq1mDGN32UFQMFYlTkizke08wuFrj1fnVUvK0EWYHQYMQkul0EEAEYAEwAZkFntmiB9AGEFAh0IsUBhIfhiKQKOhBD6w1BpM4VYhozGqfGE2BWHBYZU09iixZU+nBYgAPTdkO+ll+ZzCvWN9DNuCtlNpwOOru9yux1wL6fpx2LACcW-yPb7AHU4CAFARELagsGAETJuRgMBwPzimDYpDJRCkUwcMCWAKRUILADkcj-hwOwiDK-4AMRUKGfpQPwwEXkAA)\n\nIf we didn’t mark the return value as `Readonly<Partial<T>>`, and instead just had `Partial<T>` we would once again have a type-hole and `myClone.a = 999;` would be allowed by Typescript, but would throw an exception at runtime because property a is read only as a runtime constraint.\n\n## The Takeaway\n\nLet’s step back and really look at what `inherit` was doing.
