This post goes into security for web applications.\n\n## Prevent Against SQL Injection\n\nRead about [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) and learn how to prevent it for the langauge and database you are using.\n\n## All User Input is Filtered\n\nNever trust user input.  This includes cookies and hidden form field values.\n\n## Read the Open Web Application Security Project\n\nRead [the Open Web Application Security Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project).\n\n## All Passwords are Hashed with a Salt\n\nHash all passwords using a [salt](http://security.stackexchange.com/q/21263/396) and all salts are different to prevent against [rainbow attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table).\n\nThe hashing algorithm should be bcrypt or scrypt for storing passwords.  Look into [How To Safely Sroe a Password](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/).\n\nDo **not** use MD5 or any SHA algorithm.  SHA algorithms are meant to be fast, which should not be used for trying to securely store passwords.\n\n## Use a Standard Authentication System\n\nDo not role your own authentication system.\n\n## Process Credit Card Information Correctly\n\nLook into the [PCI Security Standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) for financial security information.\n\n## Use HTTPS for Sensitive Data\n\nSet up your [SSL](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ssl/draft302.txt)/[HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) certs correctly and check it against [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).\n\n## Prevent Session Hijacking\n\nBuilt in session systems are usually premade to handle these types of attacks. It is not recommended that you roll your own, but it should have the following features:\n\n- Encrypted data traffic.  The session key in particular should be encrypted, but ideally all traffic should be encrypted by using SSL/TLS.\n- Long random session key.  Attackers should not be able to guess valid session keys.\n- Regenerating the session id after a successful login.  Prevents [session fixation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation].\n- Change the cookie value with each and every request.  This reduces the window for an attacker to hijack the session.\n\n## Prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\n\nUnfiltered query parameters that are added to the DOM are an easy way for attackers to use cross site scripting to pull data from your users.  Filter all query parameters; see [Cross-site Scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) for more information on common attacks and prevention methods.\n\n## Prevent Page Embedding\n\nYou can prevent page embedding with the following header:\n\n```\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\n```\n\nThis will cause browsers to refuse requests for framing in that page.\n\nYou can also prevent page embedding with JavaScript to prevent users from accessing your website in an iframe.  Look into this [StackOverflow solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7776281/javascript-jquery-how-to-detect-if-a-page-is-embedded-by-others).\n\n## Prevent Cross Site Request Forgeries\n\nCross site request forgeries are attacks by a malicious user whereby they craft a link to a site which a user is know to have been authenticated.  For example, say your site is a bank website; the malicious user may craft a URL for you site that when a user clicks on it, deposits money into the attacker's account.  The attacker then sends the link to users who may have been logged into your bank website.\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery):\n\n> At risk are web applications that perform actions based on input from trusted and authenticated users without requiring the user to authorize the specific action. A user who is authenticated by a cookie saved in the user's web browser could unknowingly send an HTTP request to a site that trusts the user and thereby causes an unwanted action.\n\n## Prevent Click Jacking\n\nSimilar to [Page Embedding](#prevent-page-embedding), click jacking works by:\n\n> A user might receive an email with a link to a video about a news item, but another valid page, say a product page on Amazon.com, can be \"hidden\" on top or underneath the \"PLAY\" button of the news video. The user tries to \"play\" the video but actually \"buys\" the product from Amazon.\n\nOther known exploits include:\n\n- Tricking users into enabling their webcam and microphone through Flash\n- Tricking users into making their social networking profile information public\n- Making users follow someone on Twitter[8]\n- Sharing links on Facebook\n\nSee [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) for more information.\n\n## Verify That Server Software is Up to Date\n\nMake sure that the software on your system is up to date with the latest patches.\n\n## Verify That Packages, Modules, Plugins, etc are Up to Date\n\nMake sure that the latest software used by your projest is up to date with the latest patches.\n\n## Verify That Your Database is Secured\n\nMake sure that connections to the database are at least password protected.  Verify that only the least amount of permissions are being used.\n\nMake sure that confidential information is encrypted or hashed.\n\n## Attempt to Make Your App Run As Non-Root\n\nApply [the principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and try to have your app run as non-root as often as possible.\n\n## Use the Content-Security-Policy Header\n\nSpecify the following header to make the browser only run certain content depending on its origin:\n\n**example**\n\n```\nContent-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com\n```\n\nYou can also specify the following type of content:\n\n- script-src (JavaScript)\n- connect-src (XMLHttpRequest, WebSockets, and EventSource)\n- font-src (Fonts)\n- frame-src (Frame Urls)\n- img-src (Images)\n- media-src (Audio and Videos)\n- object-src (Flash)\n- style-src (CSS)\n\n## Do Not Allow Mime Sniffing with User Uploaded Content\n\nYou can tell browsers to not try to guess Mime Types of files with the following header:\n\n```\nX-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS: nosniff\n```\n\nFor example, say a user uploads an HTML file. You intend to serve it to users as a text file, but the browser will attempt to serve it as an HTML page.  You can tell the browser that you know what you are doing and that the Mime Type you are providing is indeed correct by using the above header.\n\n## Force HTTPS Traffic\n\nYou can force HTTPS Traffic with the following header:\n\n```\nScrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n```\n\nThis will force `https://website.com` even when typing in `http://website.com`\n","contentHTML":"<p>This post was originally on a blog I started for creating web applications.

This post goes into SEO considerations for web applications.\n\n## Use Search Engine Friendly URLs\n\nUse [semantic URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL).  Semantic URLs help improve usability and accessibility of a website.  The following table from the Wikipedia entry illistrates how to use semantic URLs:\n\n| Non-semantic URL                                                | Semantic URL                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| `http://example.com/index.php?page=name`                          | `http://example.com/name`                   |\n| `http://example.com/index.php?page=consulting/marketing`          | `http://example.com/consulting/marketing`   |\n| `http://example.com/products?category=2&pid=25`                   | `http://example.com/products/2/25`          |\n| `http://example.com/cgi-bin/feed.cgi?feed=news&frm=rss`           | `http://example.com/news.rss`               |\n| `http://example.com/services/index.jsp?category=legal&id=patents` | `http://example.com/services/legal/patents` |\n| `http://example.com/kb/index.php?cat=8&id=41`                     | `http://example.com/kb/8/41`                |\n| `http://example.com/index.php?mod=profiles&id=193`                | `http://example.com/profiles/193`           |\n\n## Use Hashbangs for Dynamic Content When You Normally Use Hashes\n\nIf you normally use the hash `#` character for dynamic content, change it to the hashbang `#!`.  This allows googlebot to use `#_REQUEST[\"_escaped_fragment_\"]` instead of `#!`.\n\n## Use Push State If You Can\n\nIf the user is using Firefox or Chromium, you can use `history.pushState( object, pageName, \"./?param=1\");` so that the address bar changes, but the page does not reload.  This allows you to use `?` instead of `#!` to keep dynamic content.\n\n## Use Descriptive Links\n\nWhen creating links, refrain from using \"this\" or \"click here\" or similar phrases for your links.  Link descriptions should be descriptive.\n\n## Have an XML Sitemap\n\n> Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling.\n\nHave a [sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org/) at `/sitemap.xml` for search engines to crawl.\n\nHave a [image sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/178636) for your images!\n\nCreate a [mobile sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/2370586?rd=1)!\n\n## Use Canonical URLs For Duplicate Content\n\nUse `<link rel=\"canonical\" ... />` when you have duplicate content on multiple pages. Remember, multiple URLs that point to the same content coint as dusplicate content. Also remember that `?page=1&subject=my-subject` and `?subject=my-subject&page=1` are different pages to web crawlers!\n\n## Setup Webmaster Tools\n\nUse [Google Webmaster Tools](http://www.google.com/webmasters/) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster).\n\n## Setup Google Analytics\n\nHave [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) set up.  Or something like [Piwik](http://piwik.org/).\n\n## Have robots.txt Configured Properly\n\nSet your [robots.txt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard) file properly.  Each subdomain must have its own robots.txt file.\n\n## 301 Redirect for WWW Requests\n\n`www.example.com` or `example.com` should be your primary domain, not both. Have one 301 Redirect (Moved Permanently) to the other.\n\n## Read the Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide\n\nThe [starter guide is viewable here](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en/us/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf).\n\n### The Basics\n\n- Create unique, accurate page titles. These titles are displayed in the search results. Titles reflect what is on each individual page.\n- Use the description meta tag. Google will use them as snippets for your pages.\n- Use simple to understand (ie \"friendly\") URLs.  URLs should contain relevant words. `http://mysite.com/article/basket-ball-scores` is a friendly URL.\n- Navigation is very important for search engines.  Think of you website as folders that should be easy to navigate.  Use breadcrumbs!\n- Use [sitemaps](#have-an-xml-sitemap)!  Prepare one for users and one for search engines.\n- Use 404s when necessary.\n\n### Improving Site Structure\n\n- Create a naturally flowing hierarchy.\n- Avoid having all navigation based entirely on dropdown menus.  Your website should be accessible, pages should be conntected with normal text links.\n\n### Optimizing Content\n\n- Create compelling and useful content.\n- Offer unique and exclusive content.\n- Checkout the [Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) by Google AdWords.\n- Write easy-to-read text.  Don't embed text in images\n- Create fresh content.\n- Create content for users, not for search engines.\n- Write good anchor text: `<a href=\"...\">Top Ten Basketball Shots</a>` is a descriptive link.\n- Use `alt` tags on your images! This also helps with accessibility.\n- Use descriptive filenames for your images and assets!\n- Supply an [image sitemap file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/178636)!\n- Use heading tags correctly!  `<h1>` is the most important. `<h6>` is the least important.\n\n### Dealing with Crawlers\n\n- Restrict crawling with robots.txt.\n- Use `rel=\"nofollow\"` when necessary for links. Normally, user generated links through comment systems should be tagged with nofollow.\n\n### SEO for Mobile Phones\n\n- Configure mobiles sites so that they can be indexed accurately.\n- Create a [mobile sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/2370586?rd=1)!\n- If you use User-agents to generate your mobile site, make sure to allow `Googlebot-Mobile`!\n- If you use a seperate domain for your mobile app, redirect them to the correct page!\n\n### Promotions and Analysis\n\n- Backlinks increase the value of your site ( backlinks are links that other people post to your site).\n- Know how to utilize your social media sites.\n- Utilize the Google Webmaster Tools.\n","contentHTML":"<p>This post was originally on a blog I started for creating web applications.

This allows you to use <code>?</code> instead of <code>#!</code> to keep dynamic content.</p>\n<h2>Use Descriptive Links</h2>\n<p>When creating links, refrain from using &quot;this&quot; or &quot;click here&quot; or similar phrases for your links.  Link descriptions should be descriptive.</p>\n<h2>Have an XML Sitemap</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4\">\n<p>Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have a <a href=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/\">sitemap</a> at <code>/sitemap.xml</code> for search engines to crawl.</p>\n<p>Have a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/178636\">image sitemap</a> for your images!</p>\n<p>Create a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/2370586?rd=1\">mobile sitemap</a>!</p>\n<h2>Use Canonical URLs For Duplicate Content</h2>\n<p>Use <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; ... /&gt;</code> when you have duplicate content on multiple pages. Remember, multiple URLs that point to the same content coint as dusplicate content. Also remember that <code>?page=1&amp;subject=my-subject</code> and <code>?subject=my-subject&amp;page=1</code> are different pages to web crawlers!</p>\n<h2>Setup Webmaster Tools</h2>\n<p>Use <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/\">Google Webmaster Tools</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster\">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>.</p>\n<h2>Setup Google Analytics</h2>\n<p>Have <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a> set up.  Or something like <a href=\"http://piwik.org/\">Piwik</a>.</p>\n<h2>Have robots.txt Configured Properly</h2>\n<p>Set your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard\">robots.txt</a> file properly.  Each subdomain must have its own robots.txt file.</p>\n<h2>301 Redirect for WWW Requests</h2>\n<p><code>www.example.com</code> or <code>example.com</code> should be your primary domain, not both. Have one 301 Redirect (Moved Permanently) to the other.</p>\n<h2>Read the Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en/us/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf\">starter guide is viewable here</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Basics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create unique, accurate page titles. These titles are displayed in the search results. Titles reflect what is on each individual page.</li>\n<li>Use the description meta tag. Google will use them as snippets for your pages.</li>\n<li>Use simple to understand (ie &quot;friendly&quot;) URLs.  URLs should contain relevant words. <code>http://mysite.com/article/basket-ball-scores</code> is a friendly URL.</li>\n<li>Navigation is very important for search engines.  Think of you website as folders that should be easy to navigate.  Use breadcrumbs!</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"#have-an-xml-sitemap\">sitemaps</a>!  Prepare one for users and one for search engines.</li>\n<li>Use 404s when necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improving Site Structure</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a naturally flowing hierarchy.</li>\n<li>Avoid having all navigation based entirely on dropdown menus.  Your website should be accessible, pages should be conntected with normal text links.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Optimizing Content</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create compelling and useful content.</li>\n<li>Offer unique and exclusive content.</li>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\">Keyword Planner</a> by Google AdWords.</li>\n<li>Write easy-to-read text.  Don&#x27;t embed text in images</li>\n<li>Create fresh content.</li>\n<li>Create content for users, not for search engines.</li>\n<li>Write good anchor text: <code>&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;Top Ten Basketball Shots&lt;/a&gt;</code> is a descriptive link.</li>\n<li>Use <code>alt</code> tags on your images! This also helps with accessibility.</li>\n<li>Use descriptive filenames for your images and assets!</li>\n<li>Supply an <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/178636\">image sitemap file</a>!</li>\n<li>Use heading tags correctly!  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the most important. <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is the least important.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dealing with Crawlers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict crawling with robots.txt.</li>\n<li>Use <code>rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;</code> when necessary for links. Normally, user generated links through comment systems should be tagged with nofollow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SEO for Mobile Phones</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure mobiles sites so that they can be indexed accurately.</li>\n<li>Create a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/2370586?rd=1\">mobile sitemap</a>!</li>\n<li>If you use User-agents to generate your mobile site, make sure to allow <code>Googlebot-Mobile</code>!</li>\n<li>If you use a seperate domain for your mobile app, redirect them to the correct page!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Promotions and Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Backlinks increase the value of your site ( backlinks are links that other people post to your site).</li>\n<li>Know how to utilize your social media sites.</li>\n<li>Utilize the Google Webmaster Tools.</li>\n</ul>","contentCode":"\"use strict\";\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = {\n    a: \"a\",\n    blockquote: \"blockquote\",\n    code: \"code\",\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    h3: \"h3\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    table: \"table\",\n    tbody: \"tbody\",\n    td: \"td\",\n    th: \"th\",\n    thead: \"thead\",\n    tr: \"tr\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    ...props.components\n  };\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"This post was originally on a blog I started for creating web applications.
