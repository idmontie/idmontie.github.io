When designing and architecting systems, sometimes we as engineers like to assume things can scale infinitely. Maybe we can use larger machines, or maybe we can deploy more instances of a service. But even trying to scale systems isn’t magically infinite. It’s a smart move to understand the limitations of what we are building upfront so we can make better technology choices, and squeeze the performance out of our existing systems.\n\n![The Breaking Point](/media/2023-12-08-the-breaking-point/splash.png)\n\n## The Myth of Scaling\n\nSoftware engineering often has an optimistic mindset that scaling a service is easy: we just let the more instances of the service be deployed, and viola, perfect scaling! But the reality is a bit more complex. Instances don't always fire up instantly, services can fail unexpectedly, and not every component can scale indefinitely.\n\nThat’s why it’s important to understand the limitations of our services. Knowing where the system might buckle under pressure allows us to devise strategies to prevent these breaking points from turning into disasters.\n\nFor example, we may have a public API service with set auto-scaling rules. When the service is hit with many requests, the service spawns additional instances to handle the workload. This ends up working well in most cases, but in the real-world, the service ends up getting hit with huge bursts of requests from downstream users, rather than a steady increase of traffic. When this happens, we scale the service instances up, but now the database gets hit with too many writes and fails over, since the database was originally designed as a read heavy use-case. Of course this is a contrived example, but similar edge-cases commonly appear in complex architectures.\n\nWithout understanding the full system and the constraints of each part, it can be difficult to successfully scale.\n\n## Understanding Server Limitations\n\nA good starting point for finding your system’s breaking point is to see how it fares on a single machine. Profile the memory usage when under load, and use load testing to determine how many simultaneous requests the service can handle before performance degrades. To make sense of it all, set some benchmarks:\n\n1. Determine what it means for performance to degrade. In some systems, you may have SLAs for some percentage of requests to complete within a given response time. Other systems may have more leniency.\n2. Use readily available tools to bombard your service with requests and observe the results. For web API services, there are plenty of open source tools that can sustain issuing millions of requests a second and reporting results.\n3. Run the tests multiple times and throw out any outliers in the results. From the rest, understand the peak memory usage, peak disk usage, and peak CPU usage of the service.\n\nOnce you have the information from these types of load tests, it becomes easy to identify indicators that a service will begin to degrade. For some services it is CPU usage that will increase more than the other resources. For some services, memory can get exhausted first.\n\nThe load testing will also be a good indicator of how many requests a single instance of your service can handle before falling over.\n\n## Scaling Strategies\n\nWhen dealing with monolithic services or hefty microservices, you may find from load testing that just vertically scaling the service by adding more hardware is more cost efficient than replicating the instance.\n\nFore smaller service that use less memory and CPU footprint, it may make more sense to horizontally scale the service with many additional smaller servers being deployed.\n\nCloud services like AWS, Azure, and GCP help enable either decision. With AWS, there are many different instance types to get the right size for your specific service deployment. With the right size picked out, auto-scaling becomes a more budget-friendly option, as you're only spinning up instances that meet your specific resource requirements.\n\nCloud providers additionally have ways to detect when to auto-scale an instance based on resource usage, making load testing very informative to tune these values.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nScaling isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s about understanding the unique limitations and potential of your system. Through careful analysis, load testing, and a bit of strategic thinking, you can develop a scaling strategy that not only meets your performance needs but also keeps an eye on the cost of your system. Whether it’s beefing up your hardware or multiplying smaller instances, the key lies in making informed, tailored decisions for your system's specific demands and quirks.\n","contentHTML":"<p>Every system has its limits.

This was a startup I did with a group of friends where we aimed to create software to enable software product teams to gather customer feedback, and then action on it.\n\nI’ve been thinking about rebooting Clarity Hub for some time.

But what if we could enforce proper localization using types in Typescript?\n\n## Defining a Localized Type\n\nTypescript doesn’t natively provide an [Opaque type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_data_type) that we can use to define a string that has already been localized. If the data looks like a string, Typescript will consider it a string. We can however use utility types that simulate opaque types, like the Opaque definition in [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest):\n\n```tsx\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgeTAQwI4FcCmcC+cAZlBCHAOQwCeYOAtETgM4wUDcAUJzXXADIQAxmgA2wAF44AJgGUYUYADsA5nAC8KdNhwAeCoJHipchcpUUANHFaLVAPnZA)\n\nHere is a short example where we create a localized string and try to use a raw string and our localized string in a function:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n\nfunction createLocalizedString(s: string): LocalizedString {\n    return s as LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction example(s: LocalizedString) {\n    return s;\n}\n\nconsole.log(example('test')); // Will throw a type error\nconsole.log(example(createLocalizedString('test'))); // Works correctly\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgeTAQwI4FcCmcC+cAZlBCHAOQwCeYOAtETgM4wUDcAUJzXXADIQAxmgA2wAF44AJgGUYUYADsA5nAC8KdNhwAeCoJHipchcpUUANHFaLVAPi6ciWJUJjAISuEKg40MDiGYpIy8nYqABTMAFw2ZqoAlHHBxmEJagiccDlwfjBYUN7McGglqaGmEVz43C5uHl5wOAAeaOCiONEpwiEm4eaJiNm5+YXFNdxCXswQnQB0ohBRre1gnZFULGyJiVzTSrMLSyttHV2+-oEV-RmbgawUu3tAA)\n\nNow we have a type that we can use in our function and components to denote that we expect an already localized string to be used.\n\n## Enforcing in Components\n\nThe simplest way we can enforce that strings have already been localized is by using the type in our component’s props interface:\n\n```tsx\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction Button(props: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\n}\n```\n\nNow if we try to use that component without a localized string, we get an error:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n\nfunction createLocalizedString(s: string): LocalizedString {\n    return s as LocalizedString;\n}\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction Button(props: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\n}\n\nfunction Example() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <Button label=\"Test\" />\n            <Button label={createLocalizedString(\"Test\")} />\n        </>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAJQKYEMDG8BmUIjgcilQ3wG4AoUSWOAbzgHkwUBHAVyTgF85tcCYATzBIAtJiQBnGGXLkhIuABkIaFABtgALyQATAMowowAHYBzOAF5GzdkgA8+FWs06DR02fwAaONOPmAHwU5JhsJhjAECZwaEQoMEjOGtp6hgFmABSSAFx+HuYAlHnJrmkFFrTkcDVwRDBsUDGScCgtpanuGRRccqaJUJjonABCbDAw0QAKOGAtVTXqKABGSOolqilu6Z49cmERMFExYxPRmWCzuXCnkyYzEHOFdNV1SA1NcPbL43eBtJdHpIAHRLVbqLj2AD0PzOJmC5F6oXCkWicAAogAPFDgdRITLPBa1eqNGKZV61Wr2QIUyl0+y3NFgtaWABEABUpDBWXAoTS6QKvoyYsz1JZaHFUIkOtsKpkOVzWYUeHzaZTofzaoUekA)\n\n## Localizing Strings\n\nSo far, we’ve been using a utility `createLocalizedString` to create and use the LocalizedString type. This utility is only really practical in unit tests. For real applications, we’ll want to use a translation function from [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) or [next-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next) to do the heavy lifting. Then we just wrap the translation functions that are provided in order to use our type:\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { Opaque } from 'type-fest';\nimport { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';\n\ntype LocalizedString = Opaque<'LocalizedString', string>;\n\nfunction createLocalizedString(s: string): LocalizedString {\n    return s as LocalizedString;\n}\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: LocalizedString;\n}\n\nfunction Button(props: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button>{props.label}</button>;\n}\n\nfunction useLocalizedTranslation() {\n    const { t : originalTranslate } = useTranslation();\n\n    const t = useCallback((key: string, defaultString: string) => {\n        return originalTranslate(key, defaultString) as LocalizedString;\n    }, [originalTranslate]);\n\n    return { t };\n}\n\nfunction Example() {\n    const { t } = useLocalizedTranslation();\n    return (\n        <>\n            <Button label={t(\"test\", \"Test\")} />\n        </>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n[Playground example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#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-EglBg8gFHAwKYAIiG+if2CfFj0MCfSyYHJPM9zwAucdwYIA)\n\nHere we use `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` and wrap the `t` translation function that is returned to override the type it gives us.\n\nNow when engineers go to use the Button component, they will know they need a LocalizedString, and the most straightforward way to get it will be to use the i18next utilities that we also provide.\n","contentHTML":"<p>When building web applications, enforcing that strings be localized to the user’s preferred language can sometimes be achieved via lint rules.

For example, you might have a button that you want to track clicks on. For the sake of this article, we will use the `data-track` attribute on elements to track their usage, but you can imagine this works with any tracking implementation where you may need to explicitly call a tracking function (e.g. `track(namespace)`).\n\n## Simple Example\n\nAs requests to start tracking user events come up, typically the easiest way is to just hard code the tracking namespaces:\n\n```tsx\n<button data-track=\"chat.form.send\">Send<button>\n```\n\nAnd as the tracking grows, these might get moved to a separate file and a constant/enumeration:\n\n```tsx\nconst ChatTracking = {\n  send: 'chat.form.send',\n  attachMedia: 'chat.form.attachMedia',\n  edit: 'chat.messages.edit',\n  delete: 'chat.messages.delete',\n} as const;\n\n// usage\n\n<button data-track={ChatTracking.send}>Send</button>\n```\n\nWe have a lot of string duplication here. We might be tempted to use template strings or some other way of creating the string, but it doesn’t end up reducing any of the duplication.\n\n## Passing Namespaces\n\nAs the application grows more complex, an engineer working on another set of features ends up wanting to re-use the chat form from above. It already has some additional animation and composes together the component library widgets, why not re-use it in the context of forums.\n\nExcept now the `data-track` attribute has to be passed in as a prop:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  Forums --> ChatForm\n  Chat --> ChatForm\n  ChatForm --> SendButton\n  SendButton --> Button\n\n```\n\nThe Forums usage ends up adding its own tracking attribute, but ends up having to prop-drill down the namespace from the Forums components, through the ChatForm, to the SendButton component.\n\n## Using Context\n\nInstead, what if we wrap our features in some Context component that helps us track where our components are being used. Then we can just build up the tracking namespace based on where the component is in the feature tree, rather than having to keep track of long namespace strings.\n\nFirst let’s build a context in React:\n\n**FeatureContext.tsx**\n\n```tsx\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n/**\n * Context for tracking features\n */\nexport const FeatureContext = createContext<string[]>([]);\n```\n\nThen we’ll create a helper component that we can use throughout the application:\n\n**Feature.tsx**\n\n```tsx\nimport type { ReactNode } from 'react';\nimport { useContext, useMemo } from 'react';\nimport { FeatureContext } from './FeatureContext';\n\nexport interface FeatureProps {\n    readonly name: string;\n    readonly children: ReactNode;\n    readonly topLevel?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport function Feature({\n    name,\n    children,\n    topLevel,\n}: FeatureProps): JSX.Element {\n    const parentContext = useContext(FeatureContext);\n\n    const currentContext = useMemo(() => {\n        if (topLevel === true) {\n            return [name];\n        }\n        return [...parentContext, name];\n    }, [parentContext, name, topLevel]);\n\n    return (\n        <FeatureContext.Provider value={currentContext}>\n            {children}\n        </FeatureContext.Provider>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nUsage of this component would look like:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Forums() {\n  return (\n    <Feature name=\"forums\">\n      <ChatForm />\n    </Feature>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Chat() {\n  return (\n    <Feature name=\"chat\">\n      <ChatForm />\n    </Feature>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ChatForm() {\n  return (\n    <Feature name=\"form\">\n      <SendButton />\n    </Feature>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, in SendButton, when we actually need to use the feature context, we construct the namespace:\n\n**SendButton.tsx**\n\n```tsx\nfunction SendButton() {\n  const featureContext = useContext(FeatureContext);\n\n  return (\n    <button data-track={[...featureContext, 'send'].join('.')}>Send</button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNote: the above example has been simplified for this article’s sake. Typically some utility for reading the context, joining the namespaces, and memoizing the value would be provided.\n\nNo additional props are needed, and the Feature components can be used throughout the application as a standard mechanism for building up feature namespaces.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRather than trying to alleviate string duplication and prop-drilling as separate problems, we can leverage React Context to solve both problems at the same time and leverage context to determine where we are in a feature tree. Not only does the Feature context help with constructing the data-track attributes, but it now provides a consistent mechanism that we can use throughout the application to let components know the feature namespace they are currently in without the parent components prop-drilling the namespace down to every component.\n","contentHTML":"<p>A common pattern in larger application when trying to track feature usage is to try to namespace events.

However, Typescript can’t infer that, so we have to cast the value.\n\nAs the function gets more complex with additional feature work, this can become brittle and lead to some type-holes where we may have accidentally forgotten to set a key.\n\nOne way to get around this is to use an assert:\n\n```tsx\ntype RequireAll<T> = {\n  [K in keyof T]-?: T[K];\n};\n\nfunction ensureAllRequired<T>(obj: Partial<T>, template: RequireAll<T>): asserts obj is T {\n  for (const key in template) {\n    if (obj[key] === undefined) {\n      throw new Error(`Missing required property: ${key} in ${JSON.stringify(obj)}`);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ninterface KnownCodes {\n  code1: number;\n  code2: number;\n  code3: number;\n}\n\nconst TEMPALTE_CODES: KnownCodes = {\n  code1: -1,\n  code2: -1,\n  code3: -1,\n}\n\nfunction createValuesForKnownCodes(): KnownCodes {\n  const knownCodes: Partial<KnownCodes> = {};\n\n  // In a real example, these keys may come from some other object\n  // or external data\n  for (const key of ['code1', 'code2']) {\n     knownCodes[key as keyof KnownCodes] = dynamicValue(key);\n  }\n\n  ensureAllRequired(knownCodes, TEMPALTE_CODES);\n\n  return knownCodes;\n}\n\ncreateValuesForKnownCodes();\n\n// Stub for the example\nfunction dynamicValue(key: string) { return 0 };\n```\n\n[Playground link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#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-WsLoYQRYsGz0AxMBwSIzHMKCX1zPwpRleUlRVdVPhgvJ0GAAxWGfHUI1kJEPTrAJwP9IMQwwiMo0URdPlIux8kKfwpmgJsWxCCBnTUDQtCgQDgNAhiICgzgJCBI4xlrUjUFYAAGKAiyAA)\n\nThe above code does a **************runtime************** check that the object has all the keys that are defined in the template. This ensure that any missing keys are caught as well.\n\nI have seen other examples online where only the object is passed in, but this ends up not working if the keys are not defined in the object:\n\n```tsx\n\nfunction ensureAllRequired<T>(obj: Partial<T>): asserts obj is T {\n  for (const key in obj) {\n    if (obj[key] === undefined) {\n      throw new Error(`Missing required property: ${key} in ${JSON.stringify(obj)}`);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe above will let any empty object partial to pass the assert.\n\n## Takeaway\n\nThis ends up being a lot of work to do a runtime check to improve our typings, which I’m not sure is the best approach. Most of the time when we construct objects from an empty object, it’s difficult to ensure that the full object has been safely created.\n\nSince we have to create a template object anyway, it is almost always simpler to do the following:\n\n```tsx\ninterface KnownCodes {\n  code1: number;\n  code2: number;\n  code3: number;\n}\n\nconst TEMPALTE_CODES: KnownCodes = {\n  code1: -1,\n  code2: -1,\n  code3: -1,\n}\n\nfunction createValuesForKnownCodes(): KnownCodes {\n  const knownCodes = { ...TEMPALTE_CODES };\n\n  // In a real example, these keys may come from some other object\n  // or external data\n  for (const key of ['code1', 'code2', 'code3']) {\n     knownCodes[key as keyof KnownCodes] = dynamicValue(key);\n  }\n\n  return knownCodes;\n}\n\ncreateValuesForKnownCodes();\n\n// Stub for the example\nfunction dynamicValue(key: string) { return 0 };\n```\n\n[Playground link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#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)\n\nHere we take the easy way out and clone the template and then built the object from there.

Hopefully they can help improve your current documentation and notes to make onboarding a smooth process.\n\n## Onboarding\n\nWhen new members start, do you have processes and documentation in place to make onboarding easy?\n\n☐ Is your process written down?\n\n☐ Add a note for people onboarding continue to improve it when they walk through it. Every time a new members onboards, they should follow the documentation and update it with any missing steps or new errors and resolutions if they come across them.\n\n## Environment Setup\n\nPart of onboarding is getting your environment set up. Usually, a team will have a preferred IDE and environment set up so that it is easy to help each other if there are any problems.\n\n☐ Is the preferred IDE documented?\n\n☐ Are preferred 3rd party plugins that developers install listed and documented somewhere?\n\n☐ If there is a VPN, are all the VPN details documented?\n\n☐ Is the preferred Git usage documented? IE git-flow etc?\n\n## README\n\nEach repository should have a main README that acts as a starting point for people new to the project to read. This should be useful to people who have been at the company for years, all the way to someone new who has just received their laptop:\n\n☐ Does the README have all the steps to:\n\n1. Download\n2. Install\n3. Run\n4. Deploy\n5. Test\n\n☐ Architecture - Is the architecture documented? This doesn’t need to be all documented within the README, but the README should at least link out to external documentation that covers:\n\n1. Clients, servers, databases, 3rd party systems are documented\n2. Data flows between systems are documented\n\n☐  API Documentation - How is the API documented? This is similar to the architecture section.\n\n1. If your repo has components, is there a Storybook or similar site to document the interfaces?\n2. If your repo has web APIs, is there a OpenAPI spec that can be viewed?\n3. Other projects will want to document their APIs as well.\n\n☐ Design System - Similar to the API documentation, if there is a design system that is used or implemented, does your README call that out?\n\n1. Documentation - do you have a link to how to get to the documentation?\n2. Storybooks - is there already a live storybook link somewhere? Does your README document how to run the storybook as well?\n\n### Building and CI/CD\n\nIf your project is buildable or deployable, do you have documentation on the Build Pipeline and the CI/CD PIipelines? These are important to simplify and document. Someone new to the project should be able to follow the README in the repo to build the application and understand what happens when they push a commit to the repository.\n\n☐  Build Pipeline\n\n1. Can the app be built in one step?\n2. Is the pipeline modern?\n\n☐  CI/CD\n\n1. Is there a CI/CD runner?\n2. Is it documented?\n3. Are there lint guidelines?\n    1. Are they checked on the CI/CD?\n4. Are there unit tests?\n    1. Are they run on every commit?\n5. Are there pre-push and pre-commit hooks? You can use Husky to set these up\n\n### Testing\n\nAs mentioned above, running unit, integration, and e2e tests may be part of the CI/CD pipeline. Will new people who onboard be able to follow the repo’s README or some other document in order to understand how to test their changes? If there is code-coverage, how do new members of the team know where to find them?\n\n☐ Testing\n\n1. Is there a test pipeline\n2. Are there unit tests\n3. Are there automated code coverage reports?\n\n☐ Bundle Sizes\n\n1. Make sure tree shaking is happening correctly\n2. Analyze the bundle size with create-react-app or BundleSizeAnalyzer webpack plugin\n\n☐ Performance\n\n1. Analyze your web app for pagespeed, lighthouse rating, and [a11y](https://github.com/thecreazy/siteaudit)\n\n### External Services\n\nSometimes repositories are self-contained, but more often than not, a repository will pull external information from a service. This might be feature flags from providers like LaunchDarkly, or website content from a Content Management System (CMS). Do new members of the team need API keys for these services? Make sure to document any external services and how to access them.\n\n☐ CMS\n\n1. Are there a lot of text and content that is constantly updated?\n2. Is there a CMS already implemented?\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything to think about concerning onboarding members to a project. Documentation is nice to have, but working with the team to understand what is missing and how to improve it goes a long way to keeping the team happy and productive.\n\nI highly recommend reviewing the onboarding process from time to time and making sure that it is easy to onboard. You never know when your computer will crash and you need to set up your entire environment again.\n","contentHTML":"<p>Below are some notes I’ve taken from setting up new code repositories and onboarding new team members.

This doesn’t need to be all documented within the README, but the README should at least link out to external documentation that covers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clients, servers, databases, 3rd party systems are documented</li>\n<li>Data flows between systems are documented</li>\n</ol>\n<p>☐  API Documentation - How is the API documented?

Does your README document how to run the storybook as well?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Building and CI/CD</h3>\n<p>If your project is buildable or deployable, do you have documentation on the Build Pipeline and the CI/CD PIipelines? These are important to simplify and document. Someone new to the project should be able to follow the README in the repo to build the application and understand what happens when they push a commit to the repository.</p>\n<p>☐  Build Pipeline</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can the app be built in one step?</li>\n<li>Is the pipeline modern?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>☐  CI/CD</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a CI/CD runner?</li>\n<li>Is it documented?</li>\n<li>Are there lint guidelines?<!-- -->\n<ol>\n<li>Are they checked on the CI/CD?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Are there unit tests?<!-- -->\n<ol>\n<li>Are they run on every commit?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Are there pre-push and pre-commit hooks? You can use Husky to set these up</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Testing</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, running unit, integration, and e2e tests may be part of the CI/CD pipeline. Will new people who onboard be able to follow the repo’s README or some other document in order to understand how to test their changes? If there is code-coverage, how do new members of the team know where to find them?</p>\n<p>☐ Testing</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a test pipeline</li>\n<li>Are there unit tests</li>\n<li>Are there automated code coverage reports?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>☐ Bundle Sizes</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure tree shaking is happening correctly</li>\n<li>Analyze the bundle size with create-react-app or BundleSizeAnalyzer webpack plugin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>☐ Performance</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Analyze your web app for pagespeed, lighthouse rating, and <a href=\"https://github.com/thecreazy/siteaudit\">a11y</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>External Services</h3>\n<p>Sometimes repositories are self-contained, but more often than not, a repository will pull external information from a service. This might be feature flags from providers like LaunchDarkly, or website content from a Content Management System (CMS). Do new members of the team need API keys for these services? Make sure to document any external services and how to access them.</p>\n<p>☐ CMS</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there a lot of text and content that is constantly updated?</li>\n<li>Is there a CMS already implemented?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything to think about concerning onboarding members to a project. Documentation is nice to have, but working with the team to understand what is missing and how to improve it goes a long way to keeping the team happy and productive.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend reviewing the onboarding process from time to time and making sure that it is easy to onboard.
