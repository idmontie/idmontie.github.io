I shared this article with a colleague who I was actively working closely with on a new implementation of a design system.

At the atom level, a component's complexity follows the Surface API pattern I described very closely in the previous article. As the number of props increases, the component's complexity increases with it:\n\n$$\nC \\propto |p|\n$$\n\nIt also increases with the number of prop combinations that the type system allows:\n\n$$\nC \\propto \\prod_{n=1}^{|p|} p_n\n$$\n\nSo the goal should be to keep the number of prop combinations as low as possible to avoid the possible cartiesian explosion in size, and therefor a dramatic increase to the component's complexity. My last article described a few ways to limit the combinations by using strict typings to reduce multiple props into a single prop. In this article, I'll explore some very specific examples of this and additional ways to reduce complexity.\n\n## Reducing Prop Complexity\n\nBefore we dive into reducing prop complexity, I'd like to split the types of Design Systems I am going to discuss into two categories: those meant to serve many different projects, and those meant to serve a handful of projects.\n\nHeroUI (formerly NextUI), Boostrap, Material Design, etc are the former. They are meant to be flexible enough to serve a wide range of use-cases. The components contained in these design systems will often exhibit the complexity explosion caused by the cartesian product of the props they have to support. For example, let's look at the prop types for just the button in HeroUI:\n\n![HeroUI button props](/media/2026-02-01-api-complexity-revisited/heorui-button-props.png)\n\nWe'll focus on just the first three props after `children`: we have 7 different variants, 6 colors, and 3 sizes. Just these props alone means we already have 126 different ways the button can be styled. If we want to ensure a change does not break anything, I would expect the CI to take snapshots of these 126 different combinations. Which means 126 states to capture, snapshot, and review. We haven't even taken into account that these buttons can have normal, hovered, pressed, and disabled states. Or that they can have startContent, endContent, or loading states as well.\n\nOn the other hand, if we are designing for an internal design system, we can be much more discerning in the props we allow. We might use HeroUI, Boostrap, or another UI toolkit as a base, however, when constructing an internal design system, the mainainters should aim to reduce the API complexity as much as possible. This helps both the maintainers keep a consistent design without introducing breaking changes everytime there is an update, and helps the consumers be able to work with a straightfoward design system. The internal design system can act as a facade for the more generic component library, and in doing so will achieve two benefits: 1. it enables a layer to allow the internals of the design system to change without impacting the consumers, and 2. it provides a reduced API complexity to consumers which is our main goal in this article.\n\nMost of the reduction in prop complexity from facading the general design system component in our internal design system is made by making strong opinions. If we can determine that there will only ever be two kinds of buttons on our site – DefaultButton and PrimaryButton – we can reduce the complexity of the API by omitting secondary, success, warning, danger, and other variants. Likewise, if we know we only want Solid and Bordered versions of buttons, we can mit light, flat, faded, shadow, and gost variants. This alone reduces the possible combinations from 126 to just 12 button states. We may even have the opinion that there will never be a Bordered Primary Button, and we can omit that type combination from the props to reduce the number of button states even further.\n\nThese examples cover in more concrete terms what I abstractly covered in my last article. We can reduce complexity of atom-level components by restricting the number of props, the size of those props, and the prop combinations that are invalid. The next section will cover a new technique that comes up when designing molecule-level components.\n\n## Reducing Props Complexity Via Composition\n\nImagine we have an Accordion component. This accordion can be open or closed, it can have a title, icon, description and content. When it has an icon, the size of the title and description must account for it. When there is no description, we want to ensure that the icon and title are centered vertically in the space. If there is a description, we want the icon, title, and description to be top aligned.\n\nRather than thinking a the Accordion as one giant component that takes in props for its open state, title, icon, description, and content, we can *decompose* the Accordion into smaller components with their own APIs.\n\nIf we try to write the Accordion as one large component, we have:\n\n* `isOpen: boolean` - 2 states\n* `title: string` - 1 state\n* `description: string | undefined` - 2 states\n* `icon: IconComponent | undefined` - 2 states\n* `content: JSX.Element` - 1 state\n\nAltogether, this has 8 state combinations.\n\nIf we split the component into an Accordion and an AccordionHeader, we have for the Accordion:\n\n* `isOpen: boolean` - 2 states\n* `header: AccordionHeader` - 1 state\n* `content: JSX.Element` - 1 state\n\nAnd AccordionHeader:\n\n* `title: string` - 1 state\n* `description: string | undefined` - 2 states\n* `icon: IconComponent | undefined` - 2 states\n\nWhich when split up leads to 2 state combinations for the Accordion, and 4 state combinations for the AccordionHeader. Meaning that the composition of the two is:\n\n$$\nC(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(f_i)\n$$\n\nThis, we only have 6 state combinations as our API complexity for the split up components instead of 8. You can see how letting consumers compose smaller components instead of giving consumers a large complex componnent that does everything, we reduce the API complexity.\n\n\n## Takeaways\n\nWhile restricting prop combinations can be extremely useful for reducing API complexity, it can be complemented by using composition to help break up molecules back into atom-size components. By pushing composition to the consumer, we can keep API complexity manageable.","contentHTML":"<p>In a previous article, I discussed <a href=\"/blog/post/2025-01-12-api-surfaces\">Surfaces</a> as an abstraction on APIs and how we could measure complexity as the size of that surfaces&#x27; perimeter – the &quot;visible&quot; part of the API to consumers.

The function signature typically looks like this:\n\n```jsx\nfunction makeFoo(partial?: Partial<Foo>): Foo;\n```\n\nThe expectation is that a software developer can call `makeFoo` and get a version of `Foo` that has all the defaults set to use in tests. Then, if the developer want to override a few fields to test an edge case, all they do is call `makeFoo({ fieldA: 'special-case })`.\n\nI’ve seen developers try to implement this a few ways, each with its pros and cons.\n\n### Spreading\n\nThe easiest way to implement this function is to just provide defaults and spread the partial:\n\n```jsx\ninterface Foo {\n  fieldA: string;\n  fieldB?: string;\n  fieldC?: boolean | null;\n}\n\nfunction makeFoo(partial?: Partial<Foo>): Foo {\n  return {\n\t  fieldA: 'test',\n    fieldB: 'example',\n    fieldC: false,\n    ...partial\n  };\n}\n```\n\nHere, we create a `Foo`  mock with overrides for the defaults, which are provided by `partial?: Partial<Foo>` . However, even though `fieldA` is required, we can see a type-hole with the default Typescript compilation settings:\n\n```jsx\nconst instance = makeFoo({ fieldA: undefined, fieldB: undefined, fieldC: undefined });\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA);\n\n// No type error, but this blows up\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA.toLowerCase());\n```\n\nWhen we spread, `undefined` actually overrides the default! But why were we allowed to provide `undefined` in the first place?\n\nIn Typescript, `Partial<Foo>`  keeps all the fields, but makes them optional. In the default compilation settings, an optional field can be set to `undefined`.\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQrdkVJkAwn2QAjTCQhwQyAD7IQAVxIk2AX1y4Y6kAjDB0SgLZwA1hAzoAFAAc4UU3BJSACq-ckAPPYAfACUNPY47FAQYOpQSngAkASi5NTIAOSQ9BkANOwpnGRcNBkQAB5wFk7yeQUcYuI08CS0EPkEBAB0PS5uwB7sOrr6COb0yKD0ikjIALzIVrb2DtgNaTRGZBBEIBBkyDohbGMgtOjyXSToTA5TYDMQXamUx-oA9O-IAHJYYACeThQ0Cg6CguRk6jAyDAAAtgLQZNcAO6I9ROXCnc6Xa63e6PZ5FChdMDoAAy6GR0HEcDaDhCxyAA)\n\nThere is a Typescript compilation flag to throw a type-error and keep our sanity: `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Enabling this flag makes Typescript show an error for `makeFoo({ fieldA: undefined, fieldB: undefined, fieldC: undefined });`. We can add the field to the call if it is set to a value.\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=true#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQrdkVJkAwn2QAjTCQhwQyAD7IQAVxIk2AX1y4Y6kAjDB0SgLZwA1hAzoAFAAc4UU3BJSACq-ckAPPYAfACUNPY47FAQYOpQSngAkASi5NTIAOSQ9BkANOwpnGRcNBkQAB5wFk7yeQUcYuI08CS0EPkEBAB0PS5uwB7sOrr6COb0yKD0ikjIALzIVrb2DtgNaTRGZBBEIBBkuevFmyDbu-uHqRInZ6D7yDohbGMgtOjyXSToTA5TYDMQLpXChPUbjd6Ar4-P4AoFFChdMDoAAy6AA7tBxHA2g4Qk8gA)\n\nBut this causes another problem: it is perfectly valid to create an initial instance of `Foo` without fieldB being set (and its value being `undefined`). But now our `makeFoo` object doesn’t allow us to pass `fieldB: undefined` anymore. Only when the interface explicitly defines fieldB as optional AND undefined does it allow us to so.\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=true#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQTZAB9kAVxBkIREBDJsCRUmQDCfZACNMJCHBCjkIcSRJsAvrlwxJCMMHQGAtnADWEDOgAUABzhR7OBINAAV-QJIAHk8APgBKGk8cdigIMHEoAzwASCVOShoAckh6QoAadjyVLiKIAA84Jx9dcsqOFVUaeBJaCAqCAgA6Yb8A4CD2cwsrBEd6ZFB6fSRkAF5kF3dPL2x27hpJaVl5ZHM4tlmQWnRdQZJ0Ji9FsGWIQeVyCnOZuZu3+8ez1e73yFEGYHQABl0AB3aCqOC9Lxxc5AA)\n\nGenerally this pattern without the flag is fine for creating mock data, since any type-holes would only be scoped to tests and not real production code. But the question is: can we have `makeFoo` take a partial, return Foo without type-holes, and have allow `undefined` for partials?\n\n## Null-Coalescing Every Field\n\nAnother common implementation I have seen is to add nullish coalescing to every field:\n\n```jsx\ninterface Foo {\n  fieldA: string;\n  fieldB?: string;\n  fieldC?: boolean | null;\n}\n\nfunction makeFoo(partial?: Partial<Foo>): Foo {\n  return {\n\t  fieldA: partial?.fieldA ?? 'test',\n    fieldB: partial?.fieldB ?? 'example',\n    fieldC: partial?.fieldC ?? false,\n  };\n} \n```\n\nLet’s also turn off the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` compilation flag for now.\n\nWe know every field will be set correctly, so there are no type-holes in `Foo`, however, we still have the problem where we cannot override a field to the `unset` value of `undefined` :\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=false&ssl=13&ssc=2&pln=1&pc=1#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQrdkVJkAwn2QAjTCQhwQyAD7IQAVxIk2AX1y4Y6kAjDB0SgLZwA1hAzoAFAAc4UU3BJSACq-ckAPPYAfACUNPY47FAQYOpQSngAkASi5NTILm7AHjwAdKmUyDw8yADkkPSlADTsKZxkXDSZfnkFXEUlpRAAHnAWTvLVtRxi4k2+2Z759eIdhB60EDUEOrr6COb0yKD0ikjIALzIVrb2DtgjaTRGZBBEIBBkVZcN1yC394-IOiFsGyC0dDyXIkdBMBw7MB7CDTMQUX64f6A4Gg8GQ6Gw7gIxGbIEw1EQgFQ4wwgoUXJgdAAGXQAHdoOI4IsHCEEUA)\n\nTurning on the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` also doesn’t save us here since we didn’t have a type-issue anyway, but more of a logic issue. `makeFoo({ fieldB: undefined })` will still set `fieldB` to `example`.\n\n## Allowing bad inputs\n\nThis last approach takes the first and second approaches above and combines them using a `pickOrDefault` function. Here if any value is passed into the partial, we will return it, except when that value would be incorrect in the output type:\n\n```tsx\nfunction isValuePresent<T extends object>(obj: T, key: keyof T): boolean {\n    return key in obj;\n}\n\nfunction pickOrDefault<T extends object, K extends keyof T>(partial: T, key: K, fallbackValue: T[K]): T[K] {\n  if (key in partial) {\n    return partial[key];\n  }\n\n  return fallbackValue\n}\n\ninterface Foo {\n  fieldA: string;\n  fieldB?: string;\n  fieldC?: boolean | null;\n}\n\nfunction makeFoo(partial: Partial<Foo> = {}): Foo {\n  return {\n\t  fieldA: pickOrDefault(partial, 'fieldA', 'test') ?? 'test',\n    fieldB: pickOrDefault(partial, 'fieldB', 'example'),\n    fieldC: pickOrDefault(partial, 'fieldC', true),\n  };\n}\n\nconst instance = makeFoo({ fieldA: undefined, fieldB: undefined });\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA);\nconsole.log(instance.fieldB);\n\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA.toLowerCase());\n\n```\n\nFor each field, we prefer the input partial, except here the type mismatch for `fieldA` forced us to add the default value twice, once if the partial didn’t have a value, and once if the partial had `undefined` which isn’t allows in the final version of `type Foo`.\n\nWhile more verbose, this does eliminate the type holes the code!","contentHTML":"<p>I&#x27;ve discussed <a href=\"/blog/post/2023-08-14-partial-objects\">full and partial objects before on this blog</a>, and in this article I&#x27;m going to investigate a common factory pattern\nin Typescript that can lead to type-holes.\nWhen writing tests or complex components, I&#x27;ll often create prop factory utilities.</p>\n<p>For tests, the goal is to create props with all the default values, except a few that may be\noveridden for a specific test case.

Some of these are borrowed from React Testing Library, whose naming scheme I like very much as it is internally consistent with the return types that certain classes of functions return, but also easy to memorize how they behave.\n\n- `getFoo` - “get” as a utility function prefix name should indicate that the function will return `type Foo` and that it is meant to be synchronous and without side-effects. Typically a `getFoo` would always return Foo from the current context or in-memory synchronous data store.\n- `queryFoo` - functions with the prefix “query” should return `type Promise<Foo>`. Querying usually implies getting data asynchronously from an external data store and may have side-effects, let alone caching that data in a synchronous store for easier data-fetching in the future. I have also seen `fetchFoo` to indicate that the function will retrieve data from an external store, but I typically reserve `fetch` for low-level wrappers of the `fetch` utility.\n- `createFoo` - similar to `getXYZ`, this creates a local, synchronously made instance of `Foo`. There may be side-effects here, but typically this function is idempotent. Following the pattern of `typeOrm` , creating an instance of `Foo` is NOT the same as making an instance with nice defaults. This instance of `Foo` might not have any data initialized, but may only come with the instance methods and unset variables.\n- `mutateFoo` or `saveFoo` - create or update an instance of `type Foo`. Typically the only side-effect in these functions is storing the data in a cache, database, file, etc.\n- `makeFoo` - this is very similar to `createFoo`, but this is typically reserved for mocks and default versions of `Foo`. For example, if you have a form with a lot of presets that a user is filling out, you might have a default version of the `Foo` object that you want to represent in your view state. When you extract that default, it would be returned in a `makeFoo` function (that might call `createFoo` in its internals to make an instance of `Foo`). Likewise, for mocks, you may want to make the process of creating a mock with a bunch of defaults simple, and have a function named `createMockFoo` with signature: `createMockFoo(overrides?: Partial<Foo>): Foo`.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but I do find it helpful to follow this pattern for code consistency and setting expectations with other software developers. If I write a function called `getFoo`, it shouldn’t query a database. If I write a `makeFoo` function, I would expect a nicely initialized `Foo` to pop out.\n\nTo me, following these conventions is similar to legalistic words like “must” and “can”. If we were to use these words in programming conventions, then `mustXYZ` would mean a function will ALWAYS return a value, no matter what, while `canXYZ` would mean the function could return `null | undefined` as well.

The scarcity was due to a few factors: the COVID pandemic had disrupted supply chains across the world, Taiwan was experiencing a severe drought that was impacting chip production, and cryptocurrency, especially ETH, was gaining value, making mining it was the latest GPU series incredibly lucrative.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nSince the supply was low and demand was high, this created two types of markets: one was the second hand market for GPUs where an \\$800 GPU could go for \\$3500 in cash when sold to someone mining cryptocurrency. Because of the massive mark up, buying and selling software to automate the process of buying GPUs when they \"dropped\" on a site was also growing as a market. These were called \"bots\" in the community, where customers trying to get a single GPU for their gaming PC were competing against hundreds of not thousands of bots flooding websites when they dropped. Common sites like Nvidia, AMD, Best Buy, and Zotac would get flooded with millions of requests when they added GPU stock the site.\n\nTo combat this, different market places tried different techniques to verify that humans were the ones trying to access the site. But due to time constraints, these never seemed to be properly implemented.\n\nZotac added a Cloudflare verification to their site that would try to verify that a user was real. The setting they used though attempted to not disrupt real users, but only issue a challenge to visitors it deemed \"bots\". A puppeteer script could easily bypass this by first visiting other sites that used cloud flare (but didn't issue challenges) and then visiting the Zotac site. A fresh puppeteer instance would be issued a challenge, but one that visited other sites before would not.\n\nThere were other tricks people used to help them attempt to secure GPUs. My favorite was adding a Zotac TShirt to your cart before a drop so that you could input all of your shipping and payment information. Then when a drop was detected, you'd simply issue the add to cart API call, and then the checkout API call. This would bypass the checkout walkthrough. When the website was flooded with millions of API calls, you only needed two API calls to succeed, rather than 10 or more.\n\n![Do something zotac](/media/2025-06-16-gpus-best-buy-queues/do-something.jpg)\n\nAutomating this way worked so well that a puppeteer script that I wrote was able to add 4 GPUs to one cart, send me a Pushbullet notification to wake me up in the middle of the night, and I just had to click one last step to verify the checkout manually since I didn't trust a script with actually making card payments on my behalf.\n\nZotac did finally learn from this and finally upped the Cloudflare bot check to issue a challenge to all users during the rest of the 30 series release. They also released a new site that made it harder to track when GPU stock was released.\n\nBest Buy must have had many complaints about the terrible system they had. Any GPU stock they had would almost immediately be gone by the time s human would show up to try to purchase one. At the time, they had a graphql-like API that allowed anyone to request with any frequency the in-stock status of any number of skus on their system. If you used puppeteer to visit the site, grab the cookies, and then issue an API request to this API, you could consistently check the status of all GPU skus every 5 or so seconds for the entire day. No rate limits, no other form of authentication other than public cookies.\n\nSo that explained how bots were able to detect GPUs so quickly and with no form of bot checking or challenge system, once the GPU was in someone's cart, it was very easy to checkout since the Best Buy site would continue to work even when flooded with requests.\n\nTo mitigate this, some poor group of developers was tasked with creating a queue system. I'm guessing the time crunch was real because when I went to investigate how this queue worked, it was entirely determined by the user cookie that was issued.\n\nHere's how the queue worked for the end user: the user would get a notification from their favorite discord server that there was a drop (since the graphql-like endpoint was still available). They would go to the page for the GPU they wanted to purchase and click \"add to cart\". The button would then change to a \"waiting in queue\" message and be disabled. There was no indication how long that queue would be. Then after some time, the button would change back to \"add to cart\". The user clicks it, and if there was still stock, the GPU would be added to cart. Then the user needed to quickly checkout before the stock ran out.\n\nI was really curious on the part where there was no indication of how long the queue was. When testing using a 5950 AMD CPU that still had stock, but had the queue system enabled, I determined that the wait time was effectively random. It didn't matter if you were the first one to click that button, it would just assign a random queue time to you before you could cart the item.\n\nI ran more tests. I recorded a small sample of wait times and they would vary from a minute to over an hour.\n\nI decided to investigate what code determined when the button changed back to \"add to cart\". No API calls were made while waiting in queue. Huh okay so the browser code already knows how long the queue time is.\n\nThe UI code on the Best Buy site is not just minified, but also mangled. This process will replace function names, introduce additional function calls to obfuscate what functions are doing, and generally makes it very difficult to debug. After tracing back what changed the button and the call stack, I was able to finally piece together how the queue time was determined.\n\nWhen a user visited the best buy site, they were issued a public cookie. It looked like a special UUID. The middle section of the UUID must have some special properties to meet some hash check value from what I could tell. The point is that I must have had some guaranteed randomness to it that gave the developers the idea to reuse this section to deterministically evaluate a queue time on both the browser and the server.\n\nI created a browser extension to test the hypothesis:\n\n1. Show the queue time for the current cookie on the page by injecting some HTML.\n2. Add a button to \"roll for a better queue time\". This would issue a request to get 20 new cookies, figure out which queue time was best, set the browser cookie to that cookies and display the new queue time.\n\nI tested with the 5950 CPU and saw my queue time go from 30 minutes to 1 minute. Success!\n\n![Queue times](/media/2025-06-16-gpus-best-buy-queues/queue-times.png)\n\nI had a close group of friends that I rolled this out to. The next Best Buy drop happened and we were all able to get the founders edition cards. Finally!\n\nThere was a popular bot net that effectively did the same thing. I don't know if they knew how to calculate the queue times, but they would spin up 20+ browsers with the best buy site and wait for the first one to have the add to cart button, and then give the purchaser of the bot net subscription the cookies for that session.\n\nTimes were dire and I thought this approach from best buy was garbage. It effectively made individuals - who might have stood a chance before - now have to wait some random amount of time against those with those who had hundreds of bots trying to get a good queue time.\n\nConveniently someone reached out to me to commission a chrome extension related to getting GPUs. They wanted to know what was possible and I told them I figured out the queue system times, and how an average person could get a better queue time. We released a branded version of my extension and some 10,000 people downloaded it.\n\nAnd then I waited for the next Best Buy drop.\n\n![A rare occurrence](/media/2025-06-16-gpus-best-buy-queues/a-rare-occurence.png)\n\nThe alert went out that there was stock.\n\n![extension](/media/2025-06-16-gpus-best-buy-queues/extension.png)\n\nAnd the website crashed 20 seconds into the drop.\n\nI was actually surprised since their site had done so well before. But I guess people rolling for new cookies 20 times in a second was enough to bring the site down momentarily.\n\nAfter that drop, Best Buy held off on GPU drops for over a month. When the next drop finally happened, they had changed the queue system slightly. The cookie was no longer the source for the queue time, and rolling for a new cookie did not give you a new queue time. Finally.\n\nYour queue position was still effectively random, but at least it could no longer be gamed by requesting new sessions. Nor could you know your queue time even if you did ask for new sessions.\n\nProps to Best Buy for continuing to experience with this too. Pokemon cards are the new drops and they force people to use the mobile app now to request a time in queue.\n","contentHTML":"<p>At the height of the GPU craze, around 2021, when everyone was holed up in their homes due to COVID, the 30 series of Nvidia GPUs was extremely difficult to purchase.

The harmonic series is written in modern notation as:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\ldots\n$$\n\nHis proof relies on finding groupings of fractions that sum greater to one\n(which his paper refers to as \"unity\"). First, look at the first 3 terms after\n\"unity\": $1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4$. When added, we see that when we set common denominators:\n\n$$\n6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13 / 12 > 1\n$$\n\nAnd in fact, for any three terms:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n - 1} + \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n+1} > \\frac{3}{n}\n$$\n\nNext Mengoli shows that there is another group of fractions that adds up to\ngreater than one, and another set of fractions after that set that also adds up\nto one. He demonstrates that for any given number, there is a finite set of\nfractions that can be added to get a value greater than that. Therefore the\nseries must diverge.\n\nHis approach here is inspired by Archimedes' \"Quadrature of the Parabola\",\nand focuses on using the \"method of exhaustion\", rather than manipulating\ninfinite series or dealing with limits.\n\nFrom this work, comes the original quote of what became known as the Basel\nproblem:\n\n> Ab huius fractionum dispositionis contemplatione feliciter\nexpeditus, ad aliam progrediebar dispositionem, in qua\nsingulæ unitates numeris quadratis denominantur.\nHæc speculatio fructus quidem laboris rependit, nondum tamen\neffecta est solvendo, sed ingenii ditioris postulat adminiculum,\nut præcisam dispositionis, quam mihimetipst proposui, summam\nvaleat reportare.\n>\n\nRoughly translating to:\n\n> Having successfully concluded my contemplation of this arrangement\nof fractions, I proceeded to another arrangement, in which\neach unit is denominated by square numbers.\nThis speculation indeed rewards labor with fruit, but it has not\nyet been completed in solving and demands the assistance of\ngreater ingenuity so that the precise sum of the arrangement\nI proposed to myself may be recovered.\n>\n\nThis is the work that perhaps sparked the inspiration for Euler's proof that the\nsum of the reciprocal of the squares adds up to $\\pi^2 /6$ . Euler required much\nmore advanced mathematics and insight in order to come up with this equality, and\nhe revisited the sum in multiple letters with slightly different arguments to\nvalidate his work.\n\nFor a full write up on this, see my self-published work here:\n\n<DownloadCard\n    href=\"/docs/on-the-addition-of-fractions.pdf\"\n    title=\"On the addition of fractions.pdf\"\n/>\n","contentHTML":"<p>I was researching the origin of the Basel problem to write a short blog post about\nhow Euler approached the problem (only to get beaten by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmtiWGnj5os\">anime characters talking\nabout it</a>).

He demonstrates that for any given number, there is a finite set of\nfractions that can be added to get a value greater than that. Therefore the\nseries must diverge.</p>\n<p>His approach here is inspired by Archimedes&#x27; &quot;Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;,\nand focuses on using the &quot;method of exhaustion&quot;, rather than manipulating\ninfinite series or dealing with limits.</p>\n<p>From this work, comes the original quote of what became known as the Basel\nproblem:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4\">\n<p>Ab huius fractionum dispositionis contemplatione feliciter\nexpeditus, ad aliam progrediebar dispositionem, in qua\nsingulæ unitates numeris quadratis denominantur.\nHæc speculatio fructus quidem laboris rependit, nondum tamen\neffecta est solvendo, sed ingenii ditioris postulat adminiculum,\nut præcisam dispositionis, quam mihimetipst proposui, summam\nvaleat reportare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Roughly translating to:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4\">\n<p>Having successfully concluded my contemplation of this arrangement\nof fractions, I proceeded to another arrangement, in which\neach unit is denominated by square numbers.\nThis speculation indeed rewards labor with fruit, but it has not\nyet been completed in solving and demands the assistance of\ngreater ingenuity so that the precise sum of the arrangement\nI proposed to myself may be recovered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the work that perhaps sparked the inspiration for Euler&#x27;s proof that the\nsum of the reciprocal of the squares adds up to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>π</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\pi^2 /6</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.0641em;vertical-align:-0.25em\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em\">π</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141em\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mord\">/6</span></span></span></span> .

Poorly architected APIs and\nincorrect abstractions can significantly impact the ability for engineering\nteams to deliver new features in a timely manner. If we consider an\nAPI's complexity as being a significant contributor to its overhead,\nmaintainability, and ease of use, then it becomes a question of how\ndo we best measure this complexity so that we can make informed decisions\nabout how to refactor and improve our APIs.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nWe will consider an API as an abstract set of functions, each with a\ndefined set of input parameters and outputs. An API can represent a library,\nan interface, or a set of functions in a design system.\n\n## An API as a Surface\n\nA good API minimizes the complexity that a consumer needs to understand\nin order to use it. If we think of an  API as an abstract two dimensional\nsurface, then the complexity of the internals of the API - all the code\nthat is required to implement the API - is the area of that surface.\nThe API that is exposed as functions, input parameters, and outputs is\nthe perimeter of that surface. This follows from the concept that an\nAPI should act as a \"black box\" - the consumer should not need to know\nhow the API is implemented in order to use it.\n\nFrom this metaphor, we can also think of the \"best\" API as one that\nminimizes the perimeter of the surface while maximizing the necessary\narea of the surface.\n\n## The Complexity of a Surface\n\nThe perceived complexity of an API can be influenced by the number of functions,\nthe number of parameters, and the number of return values.\n\nWe will not be considering the internal state of the services that consumers\nmay need to manage. Instead, we will focus on \"idempotent\" functions - those\nthat do not have side effects and do not require any state to be managed.\n\nAbstractly, we can denote the API Surface $S$ as a set of functions $f_i$,\nwhere the complexity of each function $f_i$ is given by $c(f_i)$, and the\noverall complexity of the surface is given by:\n\n$$\nC(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(f_i)\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of functions in the surface.\n\nAs we increase the number of functions in the surface, the complexity of the\nsurface is also expected to increase.\n\n## The Complexity of a Function\n\nThe complexity of a function $f_i$ can be influenced by the number of input\nparameters, their values, and the number of return values.\n\nTake for example a function $f(x: boolean): boolean$ that takes a single\nboolean input and returns a boolean value. The complexity of this function\nis relatively low - there are only two possible input values and two possible\noutput values.\n\nIf we jump to a function $f(x: boolean, y: boolean, z: boolean): boolean$\nthen the complexity of this function is higher - there are now $2^3 = 8$\npossible input values and two possible output values.\n\nAs we increase the number of input parameters, we increase the number\nof combinations of input values that the function can accept. This\nincreases the complexity of the function:\n\n$$\nc(f_i) = \\prod_{p} |p| + |r|\n$$\n\nwhere $p$ is the set of input parameters, $r$ is the set of return values,\nand $|p|$ is size of the set of input parameters and $|r|$ is the size of\nthe set of return values. By \"size\" we  mean the number of \"meaningful\"\nvalues that a parameter type has. For example, a boolean has two meaningful values,\nbut an integer may have an infinite range of non-meaningful values. In some\nlanguages, like C, it is common for an integer to have meaningful values\nof -1 and 0, and non-meaningful values of all other integers. In the case where\nthe integer is simply a number, we would consider the size of the parameter\nto be 1, while the size of a C-like integer to be the number of \"special\" cases\nthe integer has.\n\nAaron Luu, in his article [Don't use boolean](https://www.luu.io/posts/dont-use-booleans)\nalludes to this exponential potential for complexity when using boolean\nvalues.\n\n## Tests as Consumers\n\nInterestingly, the tests for an API already act as a consumer and can demonstrate\nthe complexity of an API as it strives to cover all possible branches and use-cases.\nFor our function with 3 boolean inputs, we would need to write 8 tests to cover\nall possible input combinations. A suite of tests that check tons of combinations\nof inputs and outputs is a good indicator that the API is complex.\n\n## Techniques for Reducing Complexity\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some techniques that\ncan help reduce complexity.\n\nFirst is to identify if the parameters are truly independent. For example, let's take\nthe example:\n\n```\nf(x: boolean, y: Data | undefined): boolean\n```\n\nIf the value of $y$ is only meaningful when $x$ is true, then we can consider\n$y$ to be a dependent parameter. If we write out a matrix of possible inputs:\n\n- x: true, y: Data\n- x: false, y: Data\n- x: true, y: undefined\n- x: false, y: undefined\n\nWe can see that the value of $y$ is only meaningful when $x$ is true.\n\nWhen we have dependent parameters, we can consider using the type-system to\nhelp us manage the complexity. For example, we could just simplify the\nfunction to allow only valid inputs:\n\n```\nf(x: Data | false): boolean\n```\n\nDepending on the values of Data, this simplifies the complexity of the function by\nhalf.\n\nAnother technique is to consider reducing boolean inputs to a single enum-like\ninput type. For example, simplifying 3 boolean parameters into a single\nenum-like parameter:\n\n```\nf(x: 'all'  | 'none' | 'some'): boolean\n```\n\nThis reduces the number of possible input combinations from 8 to 3.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is one simple way to measure the complexity of an API, which shows\nthat the bigger the surface area, the more complex the API. The majority\nof this complexity comes from the combinations of input parameters and\nreturn values. By reducing the number of input parameters and return values,\nwe can reduce the complexity of the API.\n\nThis is by no means the only way to measure the complexity of an API, but\nit is a useful way to think about the complexity of an API in terms of\nthe number of possible input and output combinations.","contentHTML":"<p>Maintaining growing software is challenging.

By &quot;size&quot; we  mean the number of &quot;meaningful&quot;\nvalues that a parameter type has. For example, a boolean has two meaningful values,\nbut an integer may have an infinite range of non-meaningful values. In some\nlanguages, like C, it is common for an integer to have meaningful values\nof -1 and 0, and non-meaningful values of all other integers. In the case where\nthe integer is simply a number, we would consider the size of the parameter\nto be 1, while the size of a C-like integer to be the number of &quot;special&quot; cases\nthe integer has.</p>\n<p>Aaron Luu, in his article <a href=\"https://www.luu.io/posts/dont-use-booleans\">Don&#x27;t use boolean</a>\nalludes to this exponential potential for complexity when using boolean\nvalues.</p>\n<h2>Tests as Consumers</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, the tests for an API already act as a consumer and can demonstrate\nthe complexity of an API as it strives to cover all possible branches and use-cases.\nFor our function with 3 boolean inputs, we would need to write 8 tests to cover\nall possible input combinations. A suite of tests that check tons of combinations\nof inputs and outputs is a good indicator that the API is complex.</p>\n<h2>Techniques for Reducing Complexity</h2>\n<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some techniques that\ncan help reduce complexity.</p>\n<p>First is to identify if the parameters are truly independent. For example, let&#x27;s take\nthe example:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-auto rounded-2xl bg-[#0e005d6d] p-4 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-[#0e005d6d] dark:text-gray-100\"><pre><code>f(x: boolean, y: Data | undefined): boolean\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the value of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em\">y</span></span></span></span> is only meaningful when <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span></span></span></span> is true, then we can consider\n<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em\">y</span></span></span></span> to be a dependent parameter. If we write out a matrix of possible inputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x: true, y: Data</li>\n<li>x: false, y: Data</li>\n<li>x: true, y: undefined</li>\n<li>x: false, y: undefined</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can see that the value of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em\">y</span></span></span></span> is only meaningful when <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span></span></span></span> is true.</p>\n<p>When we have dependent parameters, we can consider using the type-system to\nhelp us manage the complexity. For example, we could just simplify the\nfunction to allow only valid inputs:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-auto rounded-2xl bg-[#0e005d6d] p-4 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-[#0e005d6d] dark:text-gray-100\"><pre><code>f(x: Data | false): boolean\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Depending on the values of Data, this simplifies the complexity of the function by\nhalf.</p>\n<p>Another technique is to consider reducing boolean inputs to a single enum-like\ninput type. For example, simplifying 3 boolean parameters into a single\nenum-like parameter:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-auto rounded-2xl bg-[#0e005d6d] p-4 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-[#0e005d6d] dark:text-gray-100\"><pre><code>f(x: &#x27;all&#x27;  | &#x27;none&#x27; | &#x27;some&#x27;): boolean\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This reduces the number of possible input combinations from 8 to 3.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is one simple way to measure the complexity of an API, which shows\nthat the bigger the surface area, the more complex the API. The majority\nof this complexity comes from the combinations of input parameters and\nreturn values.

When designing and architecting systems, sometimes we as engineers like to assume things can scale infinitely. Maybe we can use larger machines, or maybe we can deploy more instances of a service. But even trying to scale systems isn't magically infinite. It's a smart move to understand the limitations of what we are building upfront so we can make better technology choices, and squeeze the performance out of our existing systems.\n\n![The Breaking Point](/media/2023-12-08-the-breaking-point/splash.png)\n\n## The Myth of Scaling\n\nSoftware engineering often has an optimistic mindset that scaling a service is easy: we just let the more instances of the service be deployed, and voilà, perfect scaling! But the reality is a bit more complex. Instances don't always fire up instantly, services can fail unexpectedly, and not every component can scale indefinitely.\n\nThat's why it's important to understand the limitations of our services. Knowing where the system might buckle under pressure allows us to devise strategies to prevent these breaking points from turning into disasters.\n\nFor example, we may have a public API service with set auto-scaling rules. When the service is hit with many requests, the service spawns additional instances to handle the workload. This ends up working well in most cases, but in the real-world, the service ends up getting hit with huge bursts of requests from downstream users, rather than a steady increase of traffic. When this happens, we scale the service instances up, but now the database gets hit with too many writes and fails over, since the database was originally designed as a read heavy use-case. Of course this is a contrived example, but similar edge-cases commonly appear in complex architectures.\n\nWithout understanding the full system and the constraints of each part, it can be difficult to successfully scale.\n\n## Understanding Server Limitations\n\nA good starting point for finding your system's breaking point is to see how it fares on a single machine. Profile the memory usage when under load, and use load testing to determine how many simultaneous requests the service can handle before performance degrades. To make sense of it all, set some benchmarks:\n\n1. Determine what it means for performance to degrade. In some systems, you may have SLAs for some percentage of requests to complete within a given response time. Other systems may have more leniency.\n2.

This was a startup I did with a group of friends where we aimed to create software to enable software product teams to gather customer feedback, and then action on it.\n\nI've been thinking about rebooting Clarity Hub for some time. When I was devoting my time to the Clarity Hub startup, the offering was split into two parts: 1. Interviewing software for product teams, and 2. an AI and NLP set of APIs for inference and predictions.\n\nWe ended up open sourcing as much of our Clarity Hub code as we could: [Clarity Hub on Github](https://github.com/Clarityhub). This included all of our original code pivots as well. While interviewing with a few startups, a couple asked me for details on Clarity Hub and how we approached the problem domain, architectural decisions, and software design. All these notes ended up as part of the README: [Architecture notes on Github](https://github.com/clarityhub/clarityhub-server-core).\n\nLooking at all these diagrams, seeing all the incredible work I did with my small team on Clarity Hub, I can see that a lot has changed since we tackled this problem.\n\nThe first major change is that Notion has become a common name in note-taking.

Focusing on this as our differentiator is now irrelevant. Notion has released their API, new AI tools, and a plethora of other features. And while Notion doesn't provide an easy way to record, video call, automatically transcribe meetings, and pull topics from conversations, this seems pretty trivial to add as a Notion extension.
