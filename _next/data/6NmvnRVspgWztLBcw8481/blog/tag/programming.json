At the atom level, a component's complexity follows the Surface API pattern I described very closely in the previous article. As the number of props increases, the component's complexity increases with it:\n\n$$\nC \\propto |p|\n$$\n\nIt also increases with the number of prop combinations that the type system allows:\n\n$$\nC \\propto \\prod_{n=1}^{|p|} p_n\n$$\n\nSo the goal should be to keep the number of prop combinations as low as possible to avoid the possible cartiesian explosion in size, and therefor a dramatic increase to the component's complexity. My last article described a few ways to limit the combinations by using strict typings to reduce multiple props into a single prop. In this article, I'll explore some very specific examples of this and additional ways to reduce complexity.\n\n## Reducing Prop Complexity\n\nBefore we dive into reducing prop complexity, I'd like to split the types of Design Systems I am going to discuss into two categories: those meant to serve many different projects, and those meant to serve a handful of projects.\n\nHeroUI (formerly NextUI), Boostrap, Material Design, etc are the former. They are meant to be flexible enough to serve a wide range of use-cases. The components contained in these design systems will often exhibit the complexity explosion caused by the cartesian product of the props they have to support. For example, let's look at the prop types for just the button in HeroUI:\n\n![HeroUI button props](/media/2026-02-01-api-complexity-revisited/heorui-button-props.png)\n\nWe'll focus on just the first three props after `children`: we have 7 different variants, 6 colors, and 3 sizes. Just these props alone means we already have 126 different ways the button can be styled. If we want to ensure a change does not break anything, I would expect the CI to take snapshots of these 126 different combinations. Which means 126 states to capture, snapshot, and review. We haven't even taken into account that these buttons can have normal, hovered, pressed, and disabled states. Or that they can have startContent, endContent, or loading states as well.\n\nOn the other hand, if we are designing for an internal design system, we can be much more discerning in the props we allow. We might use HeroUI, Boostrap, or another UI toolkit as a base, however, when constructing an internal design system, the mainainters should aim to reduce the API complexity as much as possible. This helps both the maintainers keep a consistent design without introducing breaking changes everytime there is an update, and helps the consumers be able to work with a straightfoward design system. The internal design system can act as a facade for the more generic component library, and in doing so will achieve two benefits: 1. it enables a layer to allow the internals of the design system to change without impacting the consumers, and 2. it provides a reduced API complexity to consumers which is our main goal in this article.\n\nMost of the reduction in prop complexity from facading the general design system component in our internal design system is made by making strong opinions. If we can determine that there will only ever be two kinds of buttons on our site – DefaultButton and PrimaryButton – we can reduce the complexity of the API by omitting secondary, success, warning, danger, and other variants. Likewise, if we know we only want Solid and Bordered versions of buttons, we can mit light, flat, faded, shadow, and gost variants. This alone reduces the possible combinations from 126 to just 12 button states. We may even have the opinion that there will never be a Bordered Primary Button, and we can omit that type combination from the props to reduce the number of button states even further.\n\nThese examples cover in more concrete terms what I abstractly covered in my last article. We can reduce complexity of atom-level components by restricting the number of props, the size of those props, and the prop combinations that are invalid. The next section will cover a new technique that comes up when designing molecule-level components.\n\n## Reducing Props Complexity Via Composition\n\nImagine we have an Accordion component. This accordion can be open or closed, it can have a title, icon, description and content. When it has an icon, the size of the title and description must account for it. When there is no description, we want to ensure that the icon and title are centered vertically in the space. If there is a description, we want the icon, title, and description to be top aligned.\n\nRather than thinking a the Accordion as one giant component that takes in props for its open state, title, icon, description, and content, we can *decompose* the Accordion into smaller components with their own APIs.\n\nIf we try to write the Accordion as one large component, we have:\n\n* `isOpen: boolean` - 2 states\n* `title: string` - 1 state\n* `description: string | undefined` - 2 states\n* `icon: IconComponent | undefined` - 2 states\n* `content: JSX.Element` - 1 state\n\nAltogether, this has 8 state combinations.\n\nIf we split the component into an Accordion and an AccordionHeader, we have for the Accordion:\n\n* `isOpen: boolean` - 2 states\n* `header: AccordionHeader` - 1 state\n* `content: JSX.Element` - 1 state\n\nAnd AccordionHeader:\n\n* `title: string` - 1 state\n* `description: string | undefined` - 2 states\n* `icon: IconComponent | undefined` - 2 states\n\nWhich when split up leads to 2 state combinations for the Accordion, and 4 state combinations for the AccordionHeader. Meaning that the composition of the two is:\n\n$$\nC(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(f_i)\n$$\n\nThis, we only have 6 state combinations as our API complexity for the split up components instead of 8. You can see how letting consumers compose smaller components instead of giving consumers a large complex componnent that does everything, we reduce the API complexity.\n\n\n## Takeaways\n\nWhile restricting prop combinations can be extremely useful for reducing API complexity, it can be complemented by using composition to help break up molecules back into atom-size components. By pushing composition to the consumer, we can keep API complexity manageable.","contentHTML":"<p>In a previous article, I discussed <a href=\"/blog/post/2025-01-12-api-surfaces\">Surfaces</a> as an abstraction on APIs and how we could measure complexity as the size of that surfaces&#x27; perimeter – the &quot;visible&quot; part of the API to consumers.

The function signature typically looks like this:\n\n```jsx\nfunction makeFoo(partial?: Partial<Foo>): Foo;\n```\n\nThe expectation is that a software developer can call `makeFoo` and get a version of `Foo` that has all the defaults set to use in tests. Then, if the developer want to override a few fields to test an edge case, all they do is call `makeFoo({ fieldA: 'special-case })`.\n\nI’ve seen developers try to implement this a few ways, each with its pros and cons.\n\n### Spreading\n\nThe easiest way to implement this function is to just provide defaults and spread the partial:\n\n```jsx\ninterface Foo {\n  fieldA: string;\n  fieldB?: string;\n  fieldC?: boolean | null;\n}\n\nfunction makeFoo(partial?: Partial<Foo>): Foo {\n  return {\n\t  fieldA: 'test',\n    fieldB: 'example',\n    fieldC: false,\n    ...partial\n  };\n}\n```\n\nHere, we create a `Foo`  mock with overrides for the defaults, which are provided by `partial?: Partial<Foo>` . However, even though `fieldA` is required, we can see a type-hole with the default Typescript compilation settings:\n\n```jsx\nconst instance = makeFoo({ fieldA: undefined, fieldB: undefined, fieldC: undefined });\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA);\n\n// No type error, but this blows up\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA.toLowerCase());\n```\n\nWhen we spread, `undefined` actually overrides the default! But why were we allowed to provide `undefined` in the first place?\n\nIn Typescript, `Partial<Foo>`  keeps all the fields, but makes them optional. In the default compilation settings, an optional field can be set to `undefined`.\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQrdkVJkAwn2QAjTCQhwQyAD7IQAVxIk2AX1y4Y6kAjDB0SgLZwA1hAzoAFAAc4UU3BJSACq-ckAPPYAfACUNPY47FAQYOpQSngAkASi5NTIAOSQ9BkANOwpnGRcNBkQAB5wFk7yeQUcYuI08CS0EPkEBAB0PS5uwB7sOrr6COb0yKD0ikjIALzIVrb2DtgNaTRGZBBEIBBkyDohbGMgtOjyXSToTA5TYDMQXamUx-oA9O-IAHJYYACeThQ0Cg6CguRk6jAyDAAAtgLQZNcAO6I9ROXCnc6Xa63e6PZ5FChdMDoAAy6GR0HEcDaDhCxyAA)\n\nThere is a Typescript compilation flag to throw a type-error and keep our sanity: `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Enabling this flag makes Typescript show an error for `makeFoo({ fieldA: undefined, fieldB: undefined, fieldC: undefined });`. We can add the field to the call if it is set to a value.\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=true#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQrdkVJkAwn2QAjTCQhwQyAD7IQAVxIk2AX1y4Y6kAjDB0SgLZwA1hAzoAFAAc4UU3BJSACq-ckAPPYAfACUNPY47FAQYOpQSngAkASi5NTIAOSQ9BkANOwpnGRcNBkQAB5wFk7yeQUcYuI08CS0EPkEBAB0PS5uwB7sOrr6COb0yKD0ikjIALzIVrb2DtgNaTRGZBBEIBBkuevFmyDbu-uHqRInZ6D7yDohbGMgtOjyXSToTA5TYDMQLpXChPUbjd6Ar4-P4AoFFChdMDoAAy6AA7tBxHA2g4Qk8gA)\n\nBut this causes another problem: it is perfectly valid to create an initial instance of `Foo` without fieldB being set (and its value being `undefined`). But now our `makeFoo` object doesn’t allow us to pass `fieldB: undefined` anymore. Only when the interface explicitly defines fieldB as optional AND undefined does it allow us to so.\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=true#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQTZAB9kAVxBkIREBDJsCRUmQDCfZACNMJCHBCjkIcSRJsAvrlwxJCMMHQGAtnADWEDOgAUABzhR7OBINAAV-QJIAHk8APgBKGk8cdigIMHEoAzwASCVOShoAckh6QoAadjyVLiKIAA84Jx9dcsqOFVUaeBJaCAqCAgA6Yb8A4CD2cwsrBEd6ZFB6fSRkAF5kF3dPL2x27hpJaVl5ZHM4tlmQWnRdQZJ0Ji9FsGWIQeVyCnOZuZu3+8ez1e73yFEGYHQABl0AB3aCqOC9Lxxc5AA)\n\nGenerally this pattern without the flag is fine for creating mock data, since any type-holes would only be scoped to tests and not real production code. But the question is: can we have `makeFoo` take a partial, return Foo without type-holes, and have allow `undefined` for partials?\n\n## Null-Coalescing Every Field\n\nAnother common implementation I have seen is to add nullish coalescing to every field:\n\n```jsx\ninterface Foo {\n  fieldA: string;\n  fieldB?: string;\n  fieldC?: boolean | null;\n}\n\nfunction makeFoo(partial?: Partial<Foo>): Foo {\n  return {\n\t  fieldA: partial?.fieldA ?? 'test',\n    fieldB: partial?.fieldB ?? 'example',\n    fieldC: partial?.fieldC ?? false,\n  };\n} \n```\n\nLet’s also turn off the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` compilation flag for now.\n\nWe know every field will be set correctly, so there are no type-holes in `Foo`, however, we still have the problem where we cannot override a field to the `unset` value of `undefined` :\n\n[Typescript Playground Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?exactOptionalPropertyTypes=false&ssl=13&ssc=2&pln=1&pc=1#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgGIHt3IN4ChnIzAQA2AJgIIBcyAzmFKAOYDc+hx5AQgPw32MQrdkVJkAwn2QAjTCQhwQyAD7IQAVxIk2AX1y4Y6kAjDB0SgLZwA1hAzoAFAAc4UU3BJSACq-ckAPPYAfACUNPY47FAQYOpQSngAkASi5NTILm7AHjwAdKmUyDw8yADkkPSlADTsKZxkXDSZfnkFXEUlpRAAHnAWTvLVtRxi4k2+2Z759eIdhB60EDUEOrr6COb0yKD0ikjIALzIVrb2DtgjaTRGZBBEIBBkVZcN1yC394-IOiFsGyC0dDyXIkdBMBw7MB7CDTMQUX64f6A4Gg8GQ6Gw7gIxGbIEw1EQgFQ4wwgoUXJgdAAGXQAHdoOI4IsHCEEUA)\n\nTurning on the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` also doesn’t save us here since we didn’t have a type-issue anyway, but more of a logic issue. `makeFoo({ fieldB: undefined })` will still set `fieldB` to `example`.\n\n## Allowing bad inputs\n\nThis last approach takes the first and second approaches above and combines them using a `pickOrDefault` function. Here if any value is passed into the partial, we will return it, except when that value would be incorrect in the output type:\n\n```tsx\nfunction isValuePresent<T extends object>(obj: T, key: keyof T): boolean {\n    return key in obj;\n}\n\nfunction pickOrDefault<T extends object, K extends keyof T>(partial: T, key: K, fallbackValue: T[K]): T[K] {\n  if (key in partial) {\n    return partial[key];\n  }\n\n  return fallbackValue\n}\n\ninterface Foo {\n  fieldA: string;\n  fieldB?: string;\n  fieldC?: boolean | null;\n}\n\nfunction makeFoo(partial: Partial<Foo> = {}): Foo {\n  return {\n\t  fieldA: pickOrDefault(partial, 'fieldA', 'test') ?? 'test',\n    fieldB: pickOrDefault(partial, 'fieldB', 'example'),\n    fieldC: pickOrDefault(partial, 'fieldC', true),\n  };\n}\n\nconst instance = makeFoo({ fieldA: undefined, fieldB: undefined });\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA);\nconsole.log(instance.fieldB);\n\nconsole.log(instance.fieldA.toLowerCase());\n\n```\n\nFor each field, we prefer the input partial, except here the type mismatch for `fieldA` forced us to add the default value twice, once if the partial didn’t have a value, and once if the partial had `undefined` which isn’t allows in the final version of `type Foo`.\n\nWhile more verbose, this does eliminate the type holes the code!","contentHTML":"<p>I&#x27;ve discussed <a href=\"/blog/post/2023-08-14-partial-objects\">full and partial objects before on this blog</a>, and in this article I&#x27;m going to investigate a common factory pattern\nin Typescript that can lead to type-holes.\nWhen writing tests or complex components, I&#x27;ll often create prop factory utilities.</p>\n<p>For tests, the goal is to create props with all the default values, except a few that may be\noveridden for a specific test case.

Some of these are borrowed from React Testing Library, whose naming scheme I like very much as it is internally consistent with the return types that certain classes of functions return, but also easy to memorize how they behave.\n\n- `getFoo` - “get” as a utility function prefix name should indicate that the function will return `type Foo` and that it is meant to be synchronous and without side-effects. Typically a `getFoo` would always return Foo from the current context or in-memory synchronous data store.\n- `queryFoo` - functions with the prefix “query” should return `type Promise<Foo>`. Querying usually implies getting data asynchronously from an external data store and may have side-effects, let alone caching that data in a synchronous store for easier data-fetching in the future. I have also seen `fetchFoo` to indicate that the function will retrieve data from an external store, but I typically reserve `fetch` for low-level wrappers of the `fetch` utility.\n- `createFoo` - similar to `getXYZ`, this creates a local, synchronously made instance of `Foo`. There may be side-effects here, but typically this function is idempotent. Following the pattern of `typeOrm` , creating an instance of `Foo` is NOT the same as making an instance with nice defaults. This instance of `Foo` might not have any data initialized, but may only come with the instance methods and unset variables.\n- `mutateFoo` or `saveFoo` - create or update an instance of `type Foo`. Typically the only side-effect in these functions is storing the data in a cache, database, file, etc.\n- `makeFoo` - this is very similar to `createFoo`, but this is typically reserved for mocks and default versions of `Foo`. For example, if you have a form with a lot of presets that a user is filling out, you might have a default version of the `Foo` object that you want to represent in your view state. When you extract that default, it would be returned in a `makeFoo` function (that might call `createFoo` in its internals to make an instance of `Foo`). Likewise, for mocks, you may want to make the process of creating a mock with a bunch of defaults simple, and have a function named `createMockFoo` with signature: `createMockFoo(overrides?: Partial<Foo>): Foo`.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but I do find it helpful to follow this pattern for code consistency and setting expectations with other software developers. If I write a function called `getFoo`, it shouldn’t query a database. If I write a `makeFoo` function, I would expect a nicely initialized `Foo` to pop out.\n\nTo me, following these conventions is similar to legalistic words like “must” and “can”. If we were to use these words in programming conventions, then `mustXYZ` would mean a function will ALWAYS return a value, no matter what, while `canXYZ` would mean the function could return `null | undefined` as well.

An API can represent a library,\nan interface, or a set of functions in a design system.\n\n## An API as a Surface\n\nA good API minimizes the complexity that a consumer needs to understand\nin order to use it. If we think of an  API as an abstract two dimensional\nsurface, then the complexity of the internals of the API - all the code\nthat is required to implement the API - is the area of that surface.\nThe API that is exposed as functions, input parameters, and outputs is\nthe perimeter of that surface. This follows from the concept that an\nAPI should act as a \"black box\" - the consumer should not need to know\nhow the API is implemented in order to use it.\n\nFrom this metaphor, we can also think of the \"best\" API as one that\nminimizes the perimeter of the surface while maximizing the necessary\narea of the surface.\n\n## The Complexity of a Surface\n\nThe perceived complexity of an API can be influenced by the number of functions,\nthe number of parameters, and the number of return values.\n\nWe will not be considering the internal state of the services that consumers\nmay need to manage. Instead, we will focus on \"idempotent\" functions - those\nthat do not have side effects and do not require any state to be managed.\n\nAbstractly, we can denote the API Surface $S$ as a set of functions $f_i$,\nwhere the complexity of each function $f_i$ is given by $c(f_i)$, and the\noverall complexity of the surface is given by:\n\n$$\nC(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(f_i)\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of functions in the surface.\n\nAs we increase the number of functions in the surface, the complexity of the\nsurface is also expected to increase.\n\n## The Complexity of a Function\n\nThe complexity of a function $f_i$ can be influenced by the number of input\nparameters, their values, and the number of return values.\n\nTake for example a function $f(x: boolean): boolean$ that takes a single\nboolean input and returns a boolean value. The complexity of this function\nis relatively low - there are only two possible input values and two possible\noutput values.\n\nIf we jump to a function $f(x: boolean, y: boolean, z: boolean): boolean$\nthen the complexity of this function is higher - there are now $2^3 = 8$\npossible input values and two possible output values.\n\nAs we increase the number of input parameters, we increase the number\nof combinations of input values that the function can accept. This\nincreases the complexity of the function:\n\n$$\nc(f_i) = \\prod_{p} |p| + |r|\n$$\n\nwhere $p$ is the set of input parameters, $r$ is the set of return values,\nand $|p|$ is size of the set of input parameters and $|r|$ is the size of\nthe set of return values. By \"size\" we  mean the number of \"meaningful\"\nvalues that a parameter type has. For example, a boolean has two meaningful values,\nbut an integer may have an infinite range of non-meaningful values. In some\nlanguages, like C, it is common for an integer to have meaningful values\nof -1 and 0, and non-meaningful values of all other integers. In the case where\nthe integer is simply a number, we would consider the size of the parameter\nto be 1, while the size of a C-like integer to be the number of \"special\" cases\nthe integer has.\n\nAaron Luu, in his article [Don't use boolean](https://www.luu.io/posts/dont-use-booleans)\nalludes to this exponential potential for complexity when using boolean\nvalues.\n\n## Tests as Consumers\n\nInterestingly, the tests for an API already act as a consumer and can demonstrate\nthe complexity of an API as it strives to cover all possible branches and use-cases.\nFor our function with 3 boolean inputs, we would need to write 8 tests to cover\nall possible input combinations. A suite of tests that check tons of combinations\nof inputs and outputs is a good indicator that the API is complex.\n\n## Techniques for Reducing Complexity\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some techniques that\ncan help reduce complexity.\n\nFirst is to identify if the parameters are truly independent. For example, let's take\nthe example:\n\n```\nf(x: boolean, y: Data | undefined): boolean\n```\n\nIf the value of $y$ is only meaningful when $x$ is true, then we can consider\n$y$ to be a dependent parameter. If we write out a matrix of possible inputs:\n\n- x: true, y: Data\n- x: false, y: Data\n- x: true, y: undefined\n- x: false, y: undefined\n\nWe can see that the value of $y$ is only meaningful when $x$ is true.\n\nWhen we have dependent parameters, we can consider using the type-system to\nhelp us manage the complexity. For example, we could just simplify the\nfunction to allow only valid inputs:\n\n```\nf(x: Data | false): boolean\n```\n\nDepending on the values of Data, this simplifies the complexity of the function by\nhalf.\n\nAnother technique is to consider reducing boolean inputs to a single enum-like\ninput type. For example, simplifying 3 boolean parameters into a single\nenum-like parameter:\n\n```\nf(x: 'all'  | 'none' | 'some'): boolean\n```\n\nThis reduces the number of possible input combinations from 8 to 3.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is one simple way to measure the complexity of an API, which shows\nthat the bigger the surface area, the more complex the API. The majority\nof this complexity comes from the combinations of input parameters and\nreturn values. By reducing the number of input parameters and return values,\nwe can reduce the complexity of the API.\n\nThis is by no means the only way to measure the complexity of an API, but\nit is a useful way to think about the complexity of an API in terms of\nthe number of possible input and output combinations.","contentHTML":"<p>Maintaining growing software is challenging.

By &quot;size&quot; we  mean the number of &quot;meaningful&quot;\nvalues that a parameter type has. For example, a boolean has two meaningful values,\nbut an integer may have an infinite range of non-meaningful values. In some\nlanguages, like C, it is common for an integer to have meaningful values\nof -1 and 0, and non-meaningful values of all other integers. In the case where\nthe integer is simply a number, we would consider the size of the parameter\nto be 1, while the size of a C-like integer to be the number of &quot;special&quot; cases\nthe integer has.</p>\n<p>Aaron Luu, in his article <a href=\"https://www.luu.io/posts/dont-use-booleans\">Don&#x27;t use boolean</a>\nalludes to this exponential potential for complexity when using boolean\nvalues.</p>\n<h2>Tests as Consumers</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, the tests for an API already act as a consumer and can demonstrate\nthe complexity of an API as it strives to cover all possible branches and use-cases.\nFor our function with 3 boolean inputs, we would need to write 8 tests to cover\nall possible input combinations. A suite of tests that check tons of combinations\nof inputs and outputs is a good indicator that the API is complex.</p>\n<h2>Techniques for Reducing Complexity</h2>\n<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some techniques that\ncan help reduce complexity.</p>\n<p>First is to identify if the parameters are truly independent. For example, let&#x27;s take\nthe example:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-auto rounded-2xl bg-[#0e005d6d] p-4 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-[#0e005d6d] dark:text-gray-100\"><pre><code>f(x: boolean, y: Data | undefined): boolean\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the value of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em\">y</span></span></span></span> is only meaningful when <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span></span></span></span> is true, then we can consider\n<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em\">y</span></span></span></span> to be a dependent parameter. If we write out a matrix of possible inputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x: true, y: Data</li>\n<li>x: false, y: Data</li>\n<li>x: true, y: undefined</li>\n<li>x: false, y: undefined</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can see that the value of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em\">y</span></span></span></span> is only meaningful when <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span></span></span></span> is true.</p>\n<p>When we have dependent parameters, we can consider using the type-system to\nhelp us manage the complexity. For example, we could just simplify the\nfunction to allow only valid inputs:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-auto rounded-2xl bg-[#0e005d6d] p-4 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-[#0e005d6d] dark:text-gray-100\"><pre><code>f(x: Data | false): boolean\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Depending on the values of Data, this simplifies the complexity of the function by\nhalf.</p>\n<p>Another technique is to consider reducing boolean inputs to a single enum-like\ninput type. For example, simplifying 3 boolean parameters into a single\nenum-like parameter:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-auto rounded-2xl bg-[#0e005d6d] p-4 font-mono text-sm dark:bg-[#0e005d6d] dark:text-gray-100\"><pre><code>f(x: &#x27;all&#x27;  | &#x27;none&#x27; | &#x27;some&#x27;): boolean\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This reduces the number of possible input combinations from 8 to 3.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is one simple way to measure the complexity of an API, which shows\nthat the bigger the surface area, the more complex the API. The majority\nof this complexity comes from the combinations of input parameters and\nreturn values. By reducing the number of input parameters and return values,\nwe can reduce the complexity of the API.</p>\n<p>This is by no means the only way to measure the complexity of an API, but\nit is a useful way to think about the complexity of an API in terms of\nthe number of possible input and output combinations.</p>","contentCode":"\"use strict\";\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = {\n    a: \"a\",\n    annotation: \"annotation\",\n    code: \"code\",\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    math: \"math\",\n    mi: \"mi\",\n    mn: \"mn\",\n    mo: \"mo\",\n    mrow: \"mrow\",\n    msub: \"msub\",\n    msup: \"msup\",\n    munder: \"munder\",\n    munderover: \"munderover\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    pre: \"pre\",\n    semantics: \"semantics\",\n    span: \"span\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    ...props.components\n  };\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Maintaining growing software is challenging.
