<p>For a more concrete example, we can imagine a game where we want our player to interact with a set of agents. The input states would be the state of each agent, the user’s interaction, and maybe some global environment data. The rules may be how each agent should behave, the rules of the game, and additional context. The LLM would take these inputs, and the output is instructed to be the next state of each agent. When the LLM returns this data, the Game Engine read it and applies it to the game’s representation of each agent, showing the player the impact of their actions.</p>

The goal was to take an input text, compute an embedding, load the entire embedding datasets loaded into an AWS lambda, find the most similar set of vectors, and return the top N similar vectors in one use-case. To tackle that, we came up with the following idea.\n\nGiven a vector A, compute is similar to a unit vector U of the same dimension as A. So:\n\n```cpp\ndim(U) = dim(A)\n```\n\nAnd\n\n```cpp\nS_u = cos(θ) = A · U / ||A|| x ||U||\n```\n\nWhere S_u is the similarity with the unit vector. The unit vector just needs to be the same across all samples.\n\nFor each embedding, store the calculated S_u.\n\nIf we want to find similar vectors for a new vector B, then we compute is similarity to the unit vector.\n\nThen, we can query the database for vectors within an interval of `[S_u - ε, S_u + ε]` . This will give us a subset of the dataset that have similar similarities with the unit vector.\n\nWe can re-query increasing or decreasing ε until the top N results are found.\n\nTo further improve accuracy, we can also re-compute the similarity score using cosine similarity with the subset of vectors, which is still much faster then computing the similarity against the entire dataset.\n\nThis approach begins to break down as the cosine similarity to the unit vector chosen gets very large (`\u003e 0.4`).  We end up with the possibility of matching against vectors that are of opposite directions – the least similar vectors to the original input vector.\n\nOne solution to workaround this could be to pre-compute the similarity of a vector against unit vectors for each dimension of the input vector. But this could be 512 or more cosine similarity calculations for modern embeddings just to precompute the data. Once all unit vector similarities are calculated and stored, the range query against the database would be made against the column for which the input vector’s similarity is closest to 0.\n\nThere are a lot of real solutions to this problem, but this was a fun exercise to think about and work on.\n\n## Further reading\n\nVector similarity search is becoming increasingly popular and integrated into databases.
