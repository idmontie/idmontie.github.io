The scarcity was due to a few factors: the COVID pandemic had disrupted supply chains across the world, Taiwan was experiencing a severe drought that was impacting chip production, and cryptocurrency, especially ETH, was gaining value, making mining it was the latest GPU series incredibly lucrative.\n\n\u003c!--tuncate--\u003e\n\nSince the supply was low and demand was high, this created two types of markets: one was the second hand market for GPUs where an \\$800 GPU could go for \\$3500 in cash when sold to someone mining cryptocurrency. Because of the massive mark up, buying and selling software to automate the process of buying GPUs when they \"dropped\" on a site was also growing as a market. These were called \"bots\" in the community, where customers trying to get a single GPU for their gaming PC were competing against hundreds of not thousands of bots flooding websites when they dropped. Common sites like Nvidia, AMD, Best Buy, and Zotac would get flooded with millions of requests when they added GPU stock the site.\n\nTo combat this, different market places tried different techniques to verify that humans were the ones trying to access the site. But due to time constraints, these never seemed to be properly implemented.\n\nZotac added a Cloudflare verification to their site that would try to verify that a user was real. The setting they used though attempted to not disrupt real users, but only issue a challenge to visitors it deemed “bots”. A puppeteer script could easily bypass this by first visiting other sites that used cloud flare (but didn't issue challenges) and then visiting the Zotac site. A fresh puppeteer instance would be issued a challenge, but one that visited other sites before would not.\n\nThere were other tricks people used to help them attempt to secure GPUs. My favorite was adding a Zotac TShirt to your cart before a drop so that you could input all of your shipping and payment information. Then when a drop was detected, you’d simply issue the add to cart API call, and then the checkout API call. This would bypass the checkout walkthrough. When the website was flooded with millions of API calls, you only needed two API calls to succeed, rather than 10 or more.\n\n![Do something zotac](/media/2025-06-16-gpus-best-buy-queues/do-something.jpg)\n\nAutomating this way worked so well that a puppeteer script that I wrote was able to add 4 GPUs to one cart, send me a Pushbullet notification to wake me up in the middle of the night, and I just had to click one last step to verify the checkout manually since I didn't trust a script with actually making card payments on my behalf.\n\nZotac did finally learn from this and finally upped the Cloudflare bot check to issue a challenge to all users during the rest of the 30 series release. They also released a new site that made it harder to track when GPU stock was released.\n\nBest Buy must have had many complaints about the terrible system they had. Any GPU stock they had would almost immediately be gone by the time s human would show up to try to purchase one. At the time, they had a graphql-like API that allowed anyone to request with any frequency the in-stock status of any number of skus on their system. If you used puppeteer to visit the site, grab the cookies, and then issue an API request to this API, you could consistently check the status of all GPU skus every 5 or so seconds for the entire day. No rate limits, no other form of authentication other than public cookies.\n\nSo that explained how bots were able to detect GPUs so quickly and with no form of bot checking or challenge system, once the GPU was in someone's cart, it was very easy to checkout since the Best Buy site would continue to work even when flooded with requests.\n\nTo mitigate this, some poor group of developers was tasked with creating a queue system. I'm guessing the time crunch was real because when I went to investigate how this queue worked, it was entirely determined by the user cookie that was issued.\n\nHere's how the queue worked for the end user: the user would get a notification from their favorite discord server that there was a drop (since the graphql-like endpoint was still available).

No API calls were made while waiting in queue. Huh okay so the browser code already knows how long the queue time is.\n\nThe UI code on the Best Buy site is not just minified, but also mangled.

Show the queue time for the current cookie on the page by injecting some HTML.\n2. Add a button to “roll for a better queue time”. This would issue a request to get 20 new cookies, figure out which queue time was best, set the browser cookie to that cookies and display the new queue time.\n\nI tested with the 5950 CPU and saw my queue time go from 30 minutes to 1 minute.

The scarcity was due to a few factors: the COVID pandemic had disrupted supply chains across the world, Taiwan was experiencing a severe drought that was impacting chip production, and cryptocurrency, especially ETH, was gaining value, making mining it was the latest GPU series incredibly lucrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the supply was low and demand was high, this created two types of markets: one was the second hand market for GPUs where an $800 GPU could go for $3500 in cash when sold to someone mining cryptocurrency. Because of the massive mark up, buying and selling software to automate the process of buying GPUs when they \u0026quot;dropped\u0026quot; on a site was also growing as a market. These were called \u0026quot;bots\u0026quot; in the community, where customers trying to get a single GPU for their gaming PC were competing against hundreds of not thousands of bots flooding websites when they dropped. Common sites like Nvidia, AMD, Best Buy, and Zotac would get flooded with millions of requests when they added GPU stock the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo combat this, different market places tried different techniques to verify that humans were the ones trying to access the site. But due to time constraints, these never seemed to be properly implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZotac added a Cloudflare verification to their site that would try to verify that a user was real. The setting they used though attempted to not disrupt real users, but only issue a challenge to visitors it deemed “bots”. A puppeteer script could easily bypass this by first visiting other sites that used cloud flare (but didn\u0026#x27;t issue challenges) and then visiting the Zotac site. A fresh puppeteer instance would be issued a challenge, but one that visited other sites before would not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were other tricks people used to help them attempt to secure GPUs. My favorite was adding a Zotac TShirt to your cart before a drop so that you could input all of your shipping and payment information. Then when a drop was detected, you’d simply issue the add to cart API call, and then the checkout API call. This would bypass the checkout walkthrough. When the website was flooded with millions of API calls, you only needed two API calls to succeed, rather than 10 or more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Do something zotac\" src=\"/media/2025-06-16-gpus-best-buy-queues/do-something.jpg\" style=\"max-height:500px;margin:auto;text-align:center\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomating this way worked so well that a puppeteer script that I wrote was able to add 4 GPUs to one cart, send me a Pushbullet notification to wake me up in the middle of the night, and I just had to click one last step to verify the checkout manually since I didn\u0026#x27;t trust a script with actually making card payments on my behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZotac did finally learn from this and finally upped the Cloudflare bot check to issue a challenge to all users during the rest of the 30 series release. They also released a new site that made it harder to track when GPU stock was released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest Buy must have had many complaints about the terrible system they had. Any GPU stock they had would almost immediately be gone by the time s human would show up to try to purchase one. At the time, they had a graphql-like API that allowed anyone to request with any frequency the in-stock status of any number of skus on their system. If you used puppeteer to visit the site, grab the cookies, and then issue an API request to this API, you could consistently check the status of all GPU skus every 5 or so seconds for the entire day. No rate limits, no other form of authentication other than public cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that explained how bots were able to detect GPUs so quickly and with no form of bot checking or challenge system, once the GPU was in someone\u0026#x27;s cart, it was very easy to checkout since the Best Buy site would continue to work even when flooded with requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo mitigate this, some poor group of developers was tasked with creating a queue system. I\u0026#x27;m guessing the time crunch was real because when I went to investigate how this queue worked, it was entirely determined by the user cookie that was issued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#x27;s how the queue worked for the end user: the user would get a notification from their favorite discord server that there was a drop (since the graphql-like endpoint was still available). They would go to the page for the GPU they wanted to purchase and click “add to cart”. The button would then change to a “waiting in queue” message and be disabled. There was no indication how long that queue would be. Then after some time, the button would change back to “add to cart”. The user clicks it, and if there was still stock, the GPU would be added to cart.
